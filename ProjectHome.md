# Welcome! #

IntAct is the Molecular Interaction database at the European Bioinformatics Institute (UK). If what you are looking for is the actual data, you can visit the [IntAct database](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact).

This project contains the JAVA source code for the modules used by the IntAct project, but are completely generic so they can be used in other projects, like for instance, the [MINT](http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it) database.

Check the [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/intact/w/list) for useful developer documentation and if you have technical or development questions, please ask them to the [Developers Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/intact-developers)

# Remote access to the data #

You can access the data remotely to many Molecular Interaction databases by using [PSICQUIC](http://psicquic.googlecode.com/).
