the test package contains TestCases to test the lucene index. These test are specific for a specific database.
There are three packages:
D002: contains TestCases to test the oracle database D002
large: contains TestCases for the postgres database, that was created with the testfill-large data
medium: contains TestCases for the postgres database, that was created with the testfill-medium data

If the data in the database is changed the tests will maybe fail...
