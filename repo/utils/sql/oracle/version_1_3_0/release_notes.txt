VERSION 1.3.0


REQUEST

* Create alias audit table (incl. public synonyms, grants) & audit triggers

* Create xref audit table (incl. public synonyms, grants) & audit triggers

* We need different Alias tables, one for each parent type, so hibernate handles well the database mapping
  and constraints are enabled for the parent_ac field.

* We should be able to annotate components


TECHNICAL CHANGES

    * Added 6 new tables, having the same structure than IA_Alias: 
        IA_BioSourceAlias, 
	IA_ExperimentAlias, 
	IA_ControlledVocabAlias, 
	IA_FeatureAlias, 
	IA_InteractorAlias, 
	IA_PublicationAlias

    * Component becomes an annotated object:
        * Added 2 new tables, xref and alias for component: IA_Component_Xref, IA_Component_Alias
        * Added new table: IA_Component2Annot
        * 2 new fields for IA_Component: shortlabel and fullname

    * Creates public synonyms, audit, audit trigger for those tables

    * Grants required priviledges

    * Creates a procedure to copy existing data from IA_ALIAS and IA_ALIAS_AUDIT table to the split tables

    * Creates a procedure to copy existing data from IA_XREF and IA_XREF_AUDIT table to the split tables

    * Script to run the procedures

    * Triggers to maintain the coexistence with the old IA_XREF and IA_ALIAS table while everything is migrated
