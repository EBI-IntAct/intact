VERSION 1.3.0

REQUEST
* We need different Alias tables, one for each parent type, so hibernate handles well the database mapping
and constraints are enabled for the parent_ac field.
* We should be able to annotate components


TECHNICAL CHANGES
    * Added 7 new tables, with the same structure than IA_Alias: IA_BioSourceAlias, IA_ExperimentAlias, IA_ControlledVocabAlias, IA_FeatureAlias, IA_InteractorAlias, IA_PublicationAlias
    * Now a component is an annotated object:
        * Added 2 new tables, xref and alias for component: IA_Component_Xref, IA_Component_Alias
        * Added new table: IA_Component2Annot
        * 2 new fields for IA_Component: shortlabel and fullname
    * Created synonims for those tables
    * Granted the correct permissions
    * Creates a procedure to copy existing data from IA_Alias table to the splitted tables
    * Script to run the procedure
    * Triggers to maintain the coexistence with the old IA_Xref table while everything is migrated
