VERSION 1.2.2
Adaptation of Oracle scripts for PostgreSQL


REQUEST
* We need different Xref tables, one for each parent type, so hibernate handles well the database mapping
and constraints are enabled for the parent_ac field.


TECHNICAL CHANGES
    * Added 6 new tables, with the same structure than IA_Xref: IA_BioSource_Xref, IA_Experiment_Xref,
      IA_ControlledVocab_Xref, IA_Feature_Xref, IA_Interactor_Xref, IA_Publication_Xref
    * Created synonims for those tables
    * Granted the correct permissions
    * PL*SQL procedure allowing to split IA_XREF into type-specific tables (e.g. IA_INTERACTOR_XREF...)
