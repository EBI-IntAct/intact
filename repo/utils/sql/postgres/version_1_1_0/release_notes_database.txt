CHANGES

1) ADD COLUMN CREATED_USER
a) Adding column created_user to all tables so we can keep track of who create the record.
b) also added a new table IA_DB_INFO for meta-data about the database-schema. Inserted the key:value pair: schema_version:1.1.0.

2) UPDATE NEW COLUMN CREATED_USER
this is not possible under postgres as we do not have audit tables.

3) ADJUSTED TRIGGERS 
no triggers developed so far in postgres.

4) DROP COLUMN timestamp in main.

5) create a new table that will allow to store metadata for the database.
