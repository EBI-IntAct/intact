        The attributes of CacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Sets the fully qualified class name to be registered as the CacheManager event listener.

    The events include:
    - adding a Cache
    - removing a Cache

    Callbacks to listener methods are synchronous and unsynchronized. It is the responsibility of the implementer
    to safely handle the potential performance and thread safety issues depending on what their listener is doing.

    If no class is specified, no listener is created. There is no default.

        (Enable for distributed operation)

        Specifies a CacheManagerPeerProviderFactory which will be used to create a CacheManagerPeerProvider, which
        discovers other CacheManagers in the cluster.

         The attributes of cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system with two means of discovery of CacheManager peers
        participating in the cluster:
         - automatic, using a multicast group. This one automatically discovers peers and detects changes such as
           peers entering and leaving the group
         - manual, using manual rmiURL configuration. A hardcoded list of peers is provided at configuration time.

        Configuring Automatic Discovery:
        Automatic discovery is configured as per the following example:
        <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                              properties="peerDiscovery=automatic, multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1, multicastGroupPort=4446"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "automatic"
        - multicastGroupAddress (mandatory) - specify a valid multicast group address
        - multicastGroupPort (mandatory) - specify a dedicated port for the multicast hearbeat traffic

        Configuring Manual Discovery:
        Manual discovery is configured as per the following example:
        <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                              properties="peerDiscovery=manual,
                              rmiUrls=//server1:40000/sampleCache1|//server2:40000/sampleCache1|//server1:40000/sampleCache2|//server2:40000/sampleCache2"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "manual"
        - rmiUrls (mandatory) - specify a pipe separated list of rmiUrls, in the form //hostname:port

        The hostname is the hostname of the remote CacheManager peer. The port is the listening port of the RMICacheManagerPeerListener
        of the remote CacheManager peer.

        (Enable for distributed operation)

        Specifies a CacheManagerPeerListenerFactory which will be used to create a CacheManagerPeerListener, which
        listens for messages from cache replicators participating in the cluster.

         The attributes of cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system. The listener component is RMICacheManagerPeerListener
        which is configured using RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory. It is configured as per the following example:

        <cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory"
                              properties="hostName=localhost, port=40001, socketTimeoutMillis=2000"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - hostName (optional) - the hostName of the host the listener is running on. Specify where the host is multihomed
        and you want to control the interface over which cluster messages are received.
        - port (mandatory) - the port the listener listens on.
        - socketTimeoutMillis - the number of seconds client sockets will wait when sending messages to this listener
        until they give up. By default this is 2000ms.

                                     Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
                                     The default value is 0.

                                     The default value is false.

                                     is 120 seconds.
    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy      - Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
                                     policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
                                     First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
                                     (specified as LFU)
