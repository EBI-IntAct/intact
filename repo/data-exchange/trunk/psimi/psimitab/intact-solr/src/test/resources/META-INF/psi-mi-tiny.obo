remark: Notes:
remark: Each of the top level terms in this file is the root term of an independent controlled vocabulary
remark: mapping an element of the PSI Molecular Interaction XML schema.
remark: To facilitate handling, they all have been merged in this file, though they
remark: are essentially independent CVs describing different aspects of molecular interactions.
remark: The PSI MI schema defines short labels for controlled vocabulary terms.
remark: Where possible, short labels are reported as exact synonyms of a term in this file,
remark: The last accession number used in this file is stored in a separate file,
remark: psi-mi.lastac.
remark: It MUST be updated when this file is updated.
