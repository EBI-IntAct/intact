/**
 * The package contains the classes representing the parameters for a CC line and their interfaces.
 *
 * Two different versions of CC parameters exist because of the two versions of the CC line formats.
 *
 * The two versions need different parameters so different classes exist.
 *
 * The version 1 must be associated with the CC line writers of the first version (before 2011).
 * The version 2 must be associated with the CC line writers of the last version (starting from 2011).
