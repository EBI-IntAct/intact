1. add first author family name as a field to get around the 'gavin' vs 'gavin*' problem.
   exporting Annotation(CvTopic(  author-list & journal )) could also alleviate this problem ;)

2. newt cross reference are not showing up in the definition of interactors
   though they do as target-species in experiments.
   This should be added.
