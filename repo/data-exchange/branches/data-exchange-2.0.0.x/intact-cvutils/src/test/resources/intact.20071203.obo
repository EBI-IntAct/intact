def: "The classical two-hybrid system is a method that uses transcriptional activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction. It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) \, which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed\, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell\, but it can also be carried out in other organism."

Unpaired (single) electrons are only found in radicals and some metal ions (paramagnetic species); the EPR spectrum provides information about the environment and mobility of the paramagnetic species. The magnetic interaction of two paramagnetic centres in a protein can be used to calculate the distance between them; this allows studies of the movements and interactions of protein segments. In proteins without any intrinsic unpaired electrons it is possible to attach a radical probe (spin label). Stable nitroxide radicals can be bound to amino acid residues\, in analogy with fluorescent probes. In combination with site directed mutagenesis this method is used in particular to study structure and assembly of membrane proteins\, by measuring with EPR whether an amino acid is in a polar or non polar environment."

A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle\, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection\, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa. The entropy change is obtained by using the standard thermodynamic expression DG = DH-TDS." [pubmed:11785756 "primary-reference"]

It is consequently possible\, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR\, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact\: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the protein molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about protein structure and protein-protein interaction."

The list of peptide masses obtained by MALDI MS is automatically compared to the calculated masses of the predicted peptide fragments for each entry in the database. High mass accuracy is very important in order to obtain a statistically significant and unambiguous match This method is best applied to completely sequenced genomes and well characterised proteomes. However\, depending on the data quality\, proteins that are highly homologous to already characterised proteins (greater than 80 to 90% sequence identity) can also be identified. The retrieved sequence are evaluated by mass accuracy of the peptides\, matching of additional peptide masses in the MALDI spectrum after accounting for common modifications such as oxidation\, acrylamidation of cysteine and missed cleavages and the use of secondary information (apparent isoelectric point and molecular weight). If any ambiguity about the identification by MALDI-MS still exists\, the results must verified by an other identification method. Peptide mass fingerprint is generally carried out with a MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) instrument but can also be achieved ESI-TOF (Electrospray Ionisation time-of-flight) or LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) mass spectrometer."

Synthetic peptides that are identical with peptides synthesised in vivo are useful experimental tools for such studies. Peptides are routinely synthesised in a test tube from monomeric amino acids by condensation reactions that form peptide bonds. Peptides are constructed sequentially by coupling the C-terminus of a monomeric amino acid to the N-terminus of the growing peptide. To prevent unwanted reactions involving the amino groups and carboxyl groups of the side chains during the coupling steps\, a protecting (blocking) group is attached to the side chains. Without these protecting groups\, branched peptides would be generated. In the last steps of synthesis\, the side chain-protecting groups are removed and the peptide is cleaved from the resin on which synthesis occurs." [pubmed:14755292 "primary-reference"]

A mixture of peptides derived from a protease digestion is analysed by nanoelectrospray LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer or nanoESI MS/MS) mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry cannot be applied to dilute samples and is affected by high salt. As a consequence peptides\, normally extracted from acrylamide gels by in situ proteolysis\, are desalted and concentrated on a microcolumn followed by elution into a capillary used for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A first mass spectrum (Normal mass spectrum or Q1 mass spectrum) gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set\, differing by one amino acid\, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein\, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest\, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture.

The C-term fragment of ubiquitin is expressed as a fusion to a transcription factor that being linked to a membrane protein cannot perform its function unless it is released form the ubiquitin fusion by a specific protease. This achieved through the activity of UBP (an ubiquitin specific protease) that cleaves off the reporter protein only when a functional ubiquitin is reconstituted."

def: "Western blot is a procedure to identify and quantify proteins. A mixture of protein is first submitted to an electrophoresis in denaturing condition and then electro-transferred from the gel to a membrane. The membrane is then incubated with a primary antibody specific for a given protein or a specific residue modification in the sample under analysis. A secondary antibody\, radiolabelled or fused to fluorophore or to a chromogenic enzyme\, targets the first antibody and allows the visualisation of the protein band on the membrane."

def: "Analysis of a diffraction pattern generated by a single crystal. X-rays have a wavelength\, typically around 1 Angstrom (the diameter of a hydrogen atom). If a narrow parallel beam of X-rays is directed at a sample of a pure protein\, most of the X-rays will pass straight through it. A small fraction\, however\, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample. If the sample is a well-ordered crystal\, the scattered waves will reinforce one another at certain points and will appear as diffraction spots when the X-rays are recorded by a suitable detector. The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated\, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable protein crystals. This requires high concentration of very pure protein and empirical searching for the proper crystallisation conditions." [pubmed:14755292 "primary-reference"]

name: rna interference
def: "RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing method reproducing a naturally occurring phenomena. RNAi is the process whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA. RNAi or dsRNA-induced silencing phenomena are present in evolutionarily diverse organisms\, e.g.\, nematodes\, plants\, fungi\, and trypanosomes. The mechanisms by which RNAi works is initiated by a progressive cleavage of dsRNA into 21 to 23 nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These native siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex generates an active RISC complex. Guided by the antisense strand of siRNA\, the active RISC complex recognizes and cleaves the corresponding mRNA." [pubmed:12110901 "primary-reference", pubmed:12408823 "method reference"]

DMS induces methylation of guanine residues so DNA interaction with protein binding to AT rich sequences or to the phosphate backbone may be not detected by DMS footprinting. However as DMS diffuses across membrane it can also be used for in vivo footprinting. The experiment involves the treatment with DMS of two DNA samples with identical sequence\, one protein bound and the other naked. The two samples are treated with piperidine to induce chemical cleavage of the DMS modified guanine residues followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. Once labelled the samples are run in parallel on a gel to visualize the pattern of nested fragments sharing a common end generated by restriction enzyme(or PCR primer extension) and a variable end guanine dependent. The missing bands of the protein bound sample correspond to the guanine residues protected from modification by an interaction." [pubmed:8238889 "primary-reference"]

Confocal imaging system achieves this by two strategies\: a) by illuminating a single point of the specimen at any one time with a focused beam\, so that illumination intensity drops off rapidly and b) by the use of blocking a pinhole aperture in a conjugate focal plane to the specimen so that light emitted away from the point in the specimen being illuminated is blocked from reaching the detector. Only the light from the single point illuminated of the specimen passing through the image pinhole is detected by a photodetector. Usually a computer is used to control the sequential scanning of the sample and to assemble the image for display onto a video screen." [pubmed:14755292 "primary-reference"]

xref_analog: comment:The ATCC reference is CRL-2302. ARPE-19 is a spontaneously arising retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) cell line derived in 1986 by Amy Aotaki-Keen from the normal eyes of a 19-year-old male who died from head trauma in a motor vehicle accident. The cells were subjected to selective trypsinization for the first four passages to remove superficial cells before passaging the cuboidal basal layer. By passage 5\, the cultures appeared to be rapidly growing RPE cells\, which would form cobblestone monolayers\, which pigmented after several months in culture. The line was established in a 1\:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium and Ham's F12 medium with HEPES buffer containing 20% fetal bovine serum\, 56 mM final concentration sodium bicarbonate and 2 mM L-glutamine and incubated at 37C in 10% CO2. These cells form stable monolayers\, which exhibit morphological and functional polarity. ARPE-19 expresses the RPE-specific markers CRALBP and RPE-65. The cells exhibit morphological polarization when plated on laminin-coated Transwell-COL filters in medium with a low serum concentration. They form tight-junctions with transepithelial resistance of monolayers reaching a maximum of 50 to 100 ohms/cm2 after 4 weeks of culture. The cells are diploid and can be carried for over 30 passages. Progeny were found to undergo an additional 48 population doublings in longevity trials performed during characterization at ATCC.

def: "In vascular plants\, the root is that organ of a plant body that typically lies below the surface of the soil (compare with stem). However\, this is not always the case\, since a root can also be aerial (that is\, growing above the ground) or aerating (that is\, growing up above the ground or especially above water). On the other hand\, a stem normally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see rhizome). So\, it is better to define root as a part of a plant body that bears no leaves\, and therefore also lacks nodes. There are also important internal structural differences between stems and roots. The two major functions of roots are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients and 2) anchoring the plant body to the ground. Roots also function in cytokinin synthesis\, which supplies some of shoot needs. They often function in storage of food." [tissue list:0883 "primary-reference"]
