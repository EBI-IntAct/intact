      <title>Welcome to The MyFaces Project</title>

          JavaServer(tm) Faces implementation called "Apache MyFaces".</p>

      <title>What is JavaServer(tm) Faces?</title>
      <p>
          JavaServer(tm) Faces is a new and upcoming web application framework
        that accomplishes the MVC paradigm. It is comparable to the well-known
        <link href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts Framework</link> but has features
        and concepts that are beyond those of Struts; especially the component orientation.
        Look at <link href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/">Sun's JavaServer(tm)
        Page</link> to learn more about the
        <link href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=127">Java Specification Request 127
        </link> and to download the specification. You can also find a useful Tutorial there!
