Introduction

 This is the IntAct Development Site. Here you will find all the information related
 to the IntAct development. If you are interested in the IntAct Database,
 please go to the {{{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact}IntAct Data Site}}.

 IntAct is not only one application, but several modules and web applications with separated
 development but dependency relationships. Then, you can only get the sources of one of the modules
 (e.g. Search Webapp) and build only that application. You don't need to get everything to use only
 one part.
 We classify the IntAct modules in different categories:

 * <<Libraries>>: modules that generate jar files containing common classes or different functionalities.

 * <<Web Applications>>: the visible part of IntAct, the different applications to be deployed in a web container.

 * <<Web Services>>: server and client libraries to access the IntAct Web Services. Use the client libraries to access to some of
  the IntAct Services remotely.

 * <<Maven Plugins>>: maven plugins with specific functionalities related to IntAct, such as the export of the IntAct
  data to PSI XML files, etc.

 You can take a look at the {{{overview.html}Overview}} to see the list of modules with simple descriptions
 and a simple graph of the dependency relations. To see the exact dependencies of each module, click on that
 module in the list of the left and check the project dependencies on the Project Information tab.
