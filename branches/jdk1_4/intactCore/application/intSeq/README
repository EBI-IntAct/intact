README for intSeq (intactCore/application/intSeq)
**********************************************************************

DIRECTORIES:
/ (root)        : JSP and css files.
WEB-INF/lib     : Library files for web. All the files in this location are
                  included in the WAR file.
WEB-INF/classes : search specific (non Intact core) class files.
WEB-INF/tld     : The tag libraries.
WEB-INF/config  : Configuration/Property files for the application.
dist/           : Where the WAR file is created.

INSTALLATION
    no need of a database installation

    ------------------------- INTSEQ SPECIFIC COMMANDS AND ACTIONS --------------------------

BIOLOGICAL PROGRAMS:

       -The command line definition of the FASTA program
       -The URL definition of the WGETZ program (to run SRS)

    must be set up in a properties file of the application in a right way
    (in the web.xml file for the moment, but it has to be modified later)

FILES NEEDED

    The proteinFastaDownload.fasta file needs to be created
    This file stores all protein sequences of IntAct in a Fasta format
    + formatdb is processed so the FASTA program can use it as an input.

    -> the ProteinFastaDownload utility tool (util directory) has to be launched.
        In this tool, you must specify:
            - your path where the proteinFastaDownload.fasta file will be stored
            - the formatdb command line available
        in the two provided private attributes

DIRECTORIES NEEDED BY BIOLOGICAL PROGRAMS

        These program are expected to create output files. We need to create directories
        to store them for a while.
        For the moment, these files have to be defined in the SeqIdConstants class
        in the Struts/framework directory (src...)

        For the FASTA program:
            - one directory to store the input files, which contain the query protein sequence.
                    (for the moment: /ebi/sp/misc1/tmp/shuet/intactblast/fasta_files/)
            - one directory to store the output files, which contain alignment results and
              will be parsed afterwards.
                    (for the moment: /ebi/sp/misc1/tmp/shuet/intactblast/blast_files/)
            - one directory specified in the ProteinFastaDownload tool where the formatted
              IntAct FASTA file is.

       For the SRS process:
            - one directory to store the SRS output files where AC and Description
              to display it in the SRSSearchResults.jsp page
                    (for the moment: /ebi/sp/misc1/tmp/shuet/intactsrs/wgetz_files/list_acc/)
            - one directory to store the SRS output files where the protein sequence are stored
              in a FASTA format (in order to launch the Similarity Search afterwards)
                    (for the moment: /ebi/sp/misc1/tmp/shuet/intactsrs/wgetz_files/seq_fasta/)

    ------------------------- ANT COMMANDS --------------------------


BUILD
    ant war
        prepares a WAR file to be deployed in a WEB container. The WAR file is
        created in the dist/ directory.

OTHER USEFUL COMMANDS
    ant deploy (Tomcat specific)
        deploys the WAR file in the dist/ location to the CATALINA_HOME/webapps. The
        environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for this command to work
        correctly.

    ant undeploy (Tomcat specific)
        reverses the effects of 'ant deploy' command. In addition to that, this
        command also stops the WEB server (Tomcat) if it is running. As with
        deploy command, the environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for
        this command to work correctly. An error message, displayed when trying
        to shutdown the WEB server if it is not running, can be safely ignored. In
        addition to removing the WAR file, this command also removes the
        expanded directory as well. For example, CATALINA_HOME/webapps/search
        directory is removed in addition to CATALINA_HOME/webapps/search.war file.

    ant undeploy war deploy (Tomcat specific)
        runs all three targets in the specified order. Undeploys the last deployment,
        creates a new war file and deploy it again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTES
    The WAR file is being built using jar and class file from various locations.
    Given below are locations where it looks for these files:
        / (root)        - jsp and css files.
        WEB-INF/        - web.xml, struts-config.xml files and tld libraries.
        WEB-INF/lib     - all the jar files in this location.
        ../../dist/     - intact-core.jar file.
        ../../lib       - application common jar files (only a subset).
        WEB-INF/classes - intSeq class files.
