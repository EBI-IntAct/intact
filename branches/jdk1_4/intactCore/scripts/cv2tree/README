this package contains 5 different scripts to handle the cv2tree database insertion.

createTableOracle.sh:    creates a table 'treehierarchie' on a Oracle database where the tree information of the CVs are inserted
                         It takes two argument, the first one is the username and the second one is the database name.
createTablePostgres.sh:  creates a table 'treehierarchie' on a postgres database where the tree information of the CVs are inserted
                         It takes two argument, the first one is the username and the second one is the database name.
dropTable.sh:            delets the whole table 'treehierarchie' with all its terms
                         It takes two argument, the first one is the username and the second one is the database name.
insertCv.sh:             inserts one Cv that is specified in the argument.
                         It expects one argument, which is the name of the Cv that should be inserted. If the table
                         'treehierarchie' does not exist, it has to be created first.
insertSearch3CVs.sh      insert the three CVs (CvInteraction, CvIdentification, CvInteractionType) into the database.
                         it expects no argument, but it implies that the table already exist.
