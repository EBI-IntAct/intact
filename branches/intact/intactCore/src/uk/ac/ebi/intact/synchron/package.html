This package provides a capability for nodes to exchange data entries.
<p>
The package uses both Castor and OJB object-relational mapping tool to provide
an object view of a backend oracle database: OJB provides the capability to map the persistent entries contains in the database
into java Objects, and Castor the one to map the Objects into a XML file. The package contains the following
classes:

<ul>
<li>Classe for dumping data entries from database into a XML file
<li>Classe for loading data entries contain in a XML file to the database
<li>Classe for collecting the XML files from others Intact nodes
</ul>


<h3>Configuration and mapping files requirements</h3>

This package requires the configuration and mapping files for Castor and OJB, and the file Properties.pro containing
the name of the directories where the XML files have to be downloaded and from where they can be uploaded, and the prefix
used for the node (those three files should be placed into the config directory).

<h3>Dumping data: class XmlDumper</h3>

This executable class fetches into the database all data entries which ac is prefixed by the node's prefix using OJB
interface and dump it into a XML file using Castor.


<h3>Loading data: class XmlLoader</h3>

This second executable class parses an XML file by using Castor and loads the data entries contained in this file into
the database with OJB.


<h3>Collecting files: class Collector</h3>
