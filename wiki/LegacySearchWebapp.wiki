= Introduction =

Using this web application is a simple way to browse the data you have in your local database. The Legacy Search webapp is one of the original applications and has been used by IntAct until recently.

= Installation = 

The easiest way to install and run this application (and all the applications created by the IntAct team) is to checkout the source code and use Maven to start it.

== Requirements ==

To run your Search web application you will need:

  * Maven 2: to build the application
  * Subversion client: to checkout the code
  * Java 5 or higher installed

== Procedure ==

All the steps explained use the command line, so you will need to run this on a terminal. To start, checkout the code using subversion:

{{{
svn checkout http://intact.googlecode.com/svn/repo/service/trunk/search/legacy/search-app
}}}

Then, get into the new directory:

{{{
cd search-app
}}}
