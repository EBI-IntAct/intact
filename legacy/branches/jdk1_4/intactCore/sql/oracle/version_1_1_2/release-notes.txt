ORACLE VERSION 1.1.2



FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
* propagation of being updated towards the experiment field updated, in the following cases

I when the number of "children" changes in the hierachy below

II) In the given situations
In the following cases, the following letters mean
A: Alias
An: Annotation
X: Xref

experiment  (1.attr ) (2.A ,3. An, 4. X)
/ 5
interaction (6. attr) (7.A,8. An,9. X)
/ 10		     12                                 16
Component (11. attr) ->  Feature (13. A, 14. An, 15. X) -> R (17. attr)
/ 
Protein (18. Only if annotation changes from non-uniprot to uniprot)

CHANGE REQUEST 6-12-2005
 18. On protein any adding, updating and/or deleting will lead to propagation. 
These will prevent the technical problem of “mutating table” when record is deleted from IA_ANNOTATION. Namely via the foreign key constraint cascade delete, the trigger on IA_INT2ANNOT will fire. If this trigger than goes back to the IA_ANNOTATION to select for the type of annotation, it runs in the table is mutating problem.

19. Propagation in case of update of the field CRC64 in the protein record
20. propagation in case of adding, changing  of removing of XREF for proteins
21. propagation in case of adding, changing of removing Alias for proteins

TECHNICAL CHANGES
* Adding triggers to propagate the updates towards the field updated of the table ia_experiment
* To avoid the problem of "mutating tables" while propagating changes from protein (table ia_interactor) towards the interaction (also table ia_interactor) a package, a procedure and three triggers were created. In the package there is a variable id_array, which holds specific changed ac's from the table ia_interactor.in case of proteins the updated ac's are added to this package variable, in case of 
1) update of the field CRC64
2) if the field updated is changed, but none of the attributes . This allows for propagation towards protein, f.e. adding an alias, to be propagated further to interaction and in the end experiment. Processing start in the trigger TRG_AS_INTERACTOR, which used the procedure Process_Array. In the trigger TRG_BS_INTERACTOR, the array is initiated.
