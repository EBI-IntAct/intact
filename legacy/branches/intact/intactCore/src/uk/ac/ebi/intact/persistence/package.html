<body bgcolor="white">

This package provides a persistence capability for intact. Specifically interfaces are
avaialable which allow for creation and use of abstract data sources for the creation and
search of intact objects within a persistence storage mechanism.
<p>
Whilst the interfaces allow for the option of changing the underlying persistence
technology, at present intact uses the OJB object-relational mapping tool to provide
an object view of a backend oracle database. The OJB interface is hidden from users
of the intact persistence package, but the package contains both the technology-independent
classes and also the OJB-specific (and, if required, castor-specific) implementations. (Please
note the change of underlying persistence technology: OJB was chosen to replace Castor mainly for
performance, documentation and extensibility reasons.). There is also a Castor-specific implementation
which again is available via the interface if required.
<p>
The package contains the following groups of classes and interfaces:

<ul>
<li>Classes for data source creation
<li>Classes for accessing a data source
<li>Classes which provide technology-specific implementations of the persistence interfaces
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>Data Source Creation</h3>

A specific data source instance is created via the {@link uk.ac.ebi.intact.persistence.DAOFactory} class, which provides
a single point of contact for obtaining a particular data source. For web-based applications, the data source to be
returned by this factory could be specified within a servlet configuration parameter, defined in the
<code>web.xml</code> file of the webapps directory. Typically this would be the full
 classname of a technology specific implementation of the <code>DAOSource</code> interface.
 Currently intact uses the OJB-specific {@link uk.ac.ebi.intact.persistence.ObjectBridgeDAOSource} implementation, although
 this can be changed easily if required. Once a client has obtained a reference to the
 data source implementation, it is possible to then use it in order to access the persistence
 functionality. Alternatively a seperate helper class may be used (as is the case for intact) which
 encapsulates all persistence layer access.
 <p>
 The data source itself is initialised via a collection of configuration files, which are passed
 to it after its initial construction. For OJB, this is a single file called <code>repository.xml</code>,
 which defines the class-to-table mappings. In the case of castor, these are database description
 and mapping files, along with the database name. Once intitialised it is then ready to provide
 clients with connections to the persistent storage.
 <p>
 <p>
 If Castor is to be used as a persistence technology, a further parameter which may be set (via the same mechanism as setting the configuration files) is
 a <code>Map</code> of reflection information for each known type of an application. The structure of the
 <code>Map</code> should be keyed on full java classname, with the values of the <code>Map</code>
 being arrays of java type <code>PropertyDescriptor</code> (see the java.beans package for details).
 Internally the Castor-specific Data Access Object uses reflection information to optimise the
 Castor lazy loading facility (assuming the persisted objects have basic Bean structure, ie
 that each property has a get and set method). This is achieved either via the <code>Map</code>
 and the java.beans classes or, if no such <code>Map</code> is provided, by straight java reflection.
 It is recommended that users of this package construct their own <code>Map</code> and suppy it,
 since reflection can affect performance and a "one off" up-front Bean introspection will improve
 the performance.
 <p>
 <p>
 Use of OJB as the persistence technology requires no further information, unlike Castor.

<h3>Accessing the Data Source</h3>

Access to the data source is provided via the <code>DAO</code> interface. This interface defines
 a number of the more common operations provided by most persistence technologies - for example
 creating and searching for objects, transaction management and so on. It is therefore possible
 for clients of the <code>DAO</code> interface to manage their own transactions, but in cases
 where this would not be appropriate (for example in a web environment), implementations of the
 interface should manage transactions themselves, and therefore removing the need for clients
 to worry about transactions.
 <p>
 <h3>Technology-specific Persistence Implementations</h3>

 <h4>ObjectRelationalBridge (OJB)</h4>
 <p>
 The {@link uk.ac.ebi.intact.persistence.ObjectBridgeDAO} class provides an OJB-specific implementation
 of the DAO interface, utilising both the PersistenceBroker and ODMG APIs provided by OJB (typically
 if transaction management and locking are required ODMG is used, but for straight query the PersistenceBroker
 API is used to avoid the transactional overhead of ODMG). OJB provides a more felxible method of query
 to Castor, and is better documented. Furthermore OJB is under active development via Apache, whereas
 Castor's object-relational mapping solution (JDO, *not* to be confused with the Java Data Object standard)
 is not. The OJB approach to lazy data loading is centred around the proxy concept, whereby objects may
 hold proxies to referenced objects. Full objects are then materialised on demand via the proxies. Also
 OJB has the concept of a Collection proxy, which provides a single proxy for Collection references rather
 thain requiring the maintenance of a Collection of individual proxy instances (which would be similar
 to a Castor-based approach). Furthermore objects along with their proxies are not bound to a transaction
 as they are for Castor. This makes objects retrieved available "as is" within an application, without having
 to maintain the transaction to keep the object references alive. At present it appears that OJB provides
 a superior object-relational solution to Castor - however Castor is the preferred solution for XML
 marshalling applications, since OJB does not provide such functionality.
 </p>
 <h4>Castor</h4>
 <p>
 The {@link uk.ac.ebi.intact.persistence.CastorDAO} class implements a castor-specific solution. This class, in
 a number of cases, simply wraps a castor database connection and performs typical operations
 for commit, rollback etc via delegation to the castor API. However for more complex cases such
 as searching and object creation, more functionality is included in the <code>CastorDAO</code>
  class to allow for (where necessary) transaction management, and to overcome some of the limitations
  of castor's lazy loading capability. Note however that due to Castor's lazy loading policy, although
  full objects are not materialised there will still be (in the case of a Collection) a query to fetch
  the Object ID for every item in a Collection. This is not the case with OJB, which uses a proxy-based
  lazy loading strategy.
  <p>
  Difficulties arise with standard object loading because a request for a single
  object will retrieve the complete object graph for high connectivity data structures. Castor
  attempts to overcome this by providing an "on demand" loading facility, whereby objects are
  loaded lazily (ie only when requested). This also causes problems in some cases, for example
  within a web environment. The difficulty is caused by the fact that castor lazy loading must
  be performed within the scope of a single transaction, otherwise the unloaded objects become
  "out of scope". Essentially castor repalces the objects tehmselves only with their IDs, so that
  they can be retrieved on demand within the same transaction. Howevere the IDs are invalid
  once the transaction is commited or rolled back. Since web applications cannot have transactions
  spanning requests, this makes lazily loaded objects unusable (unless the business tier is
  based on stateful Session Beans in an EJB layer, which allows transactions to span method calls).
  <p>
  The simple solution adopted for now is that when the <code>CastorDAO</code> object receives
   a search request, the object and its immediate neighbours only are loaded, but no more. It is
   likely that the nearest neighbours of a queried object will be required anyway, so this is not
   an unreasonable approach. The nearest neighbours themselves are loaded within the <code>CastorDAO</code>
   search method, since castor uses its own <code>Iterator</code> class which again goes out of
   scope when a transaction completes - hence the neighbours must be loaded and stored back again within
   a single transaction. As discussed above, this is achieved using either client-supplied java
   Bean introspection information (faster) or straight java reflection for each request (slower).
