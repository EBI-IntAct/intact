<h1>IntAct project component specification: Editing tool</h1>
This specification will gradually be completed. It describes the
desired features of the editing tool for IntActCore. The features
should be tested with IntAct Test, then applied to the full model.

<ol>
  <li><h4>Technical requirements</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>The tool should be a web-based application, using Servlet
            technology. 
        <li>The system should use HTML 4.0.
        <li>Javascript may be used only for optional features, the
            system should be functional with Javascript turned off.
        <li>As a persistence mechanism, the IntAct API should be used,
            avoiding direct SQL table access.
      </ol>
  <li><h4>Data volume</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>One submission can comprise up to 1000 objects, from all
            of the externally visible IntAct classes.
      </ol>
  <li><h4>Functionality</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>One submission may be the result of a complex editing
            process, but should only be made persistent on activation
            of a final "submit" button.
        <li>At the beginning of the editing process, the user should
            get a session ID on screen and by email. Alternatively,
            incomplete submissions could be saved attached to the
            submitter login, and the submitter could get a list of all
            his recent or incomplete submissions.
        <li>At any point in the editing process, an interruption of
            the process, through server or client failure, or
            timeouts, should only loose the data collected since the
            last server interaction, and should usually not represent
            more than ca. 10 minutes of lost work. Planned suspension of
            the editing process, and restart much later, should also
            be available. Any interrupted or suspended session should
            be retrievable by the session ID (see <a href="http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/~sp/intern/projects/intact/consortium/doc/usecases/index.html#uc49">use case 49</a>.
        <li>A graphical view of the submission, it's complete and
            incomplete components, is highly desirable.
        <li>Use cases
            <a href="http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/~sp/intern/projects/intact/consortium/doc/usecases/index.html#uc46">46</a>, 
            <a href="http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/~sp/intern/projects/intact/consortium/doc/usecases/index.html#uc47">47</a>, 
            <a href="http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/~sp/intern/projects/intact/consortium/doc/usecases/index.html#uc48">48</a>, 
            <a href="http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/~sp/intern/projects/intact/consortium/doc/usecases/index.html#uc50">50</a>, 
            <a href="http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/~sp/intern/projects/intact/consortium/doc/usecases/index.html#uc51">51</a>, 
        <li>Retrieve existing objects by query, then include them into
            the current submission. Example: Use an existing protein
            object in a new interaction.
      </ol>
