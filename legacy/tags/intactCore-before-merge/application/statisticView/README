README for StatisticView (intactCore/application/StatisticView)
**********************************************************************

DIRECTORIES:
/ (root)        : JSP and css files.
WEB-INF/lib     : Library files for web. All the files in this location are
                  included in the WAR file.
WEB-INF/classes : search specific (non Intact core) class files.
WEB-INF/tld     : The tag libraries.
WEB-INF/config  : Configuration/Property files for the application.
dist/           : Where the WAR file is created.


INSTALLATION
	Read the README file in the intact home directory to know how to configure the database access.
	
DEPENDENCIES:
       - Make sure that the table in the database are created and the scripts created the data

       - BE CAREFUL, statisticView got his OWN repository_user.xml OJB config file.
         everything is done by ant, but be carefull with modification. it stored under
         /application/statisticView/WEB-INF/config/repository_user.xml

    ORACLE:
	- The script sql/oracle/statistics/create_all_statistics.psql
	  creates the tables and  the fills it with data.

	POSTGRES: 
       	- The scripts sql/postgres/insert_count_statistics.sql
                      sql/postgres/insert_biosource_statistics.sql
	                  sql/postgres/insert_exp_statistics.sql
	      must run seperatly. postgres is not fully supported at the moment.

TODOS:
    - better postgres support
    - generation of the other charts with the update method as statistics are generated
    - the exception model could be a little bit more detailed, at the moment everything throws
      just an intact exception.
		   
		     
BUILD

    ant war
        prepares a WAR file to be deployed in a WEB container. The WAR file is
        created in the dist/ directory.

OTHER USEFUL COMMANDS

    ant deploy (Tomcat specific)
        deploys the WAR file in the dist/ location to the CATALINA_HOME/webapps. The
        environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for this command to work
        correctly.

    ant undeploy (Tomcat specific)
        reverses the effects of 'ant deploy' command. In addition to that, this
        command also stops the WEB server (Tomcat) if it is running. As with
        deploy command, the environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for
        this command to work correctly. An error message, displayed when trying
        to shutdown the WEB server if it is not running, can be safely ignored. In
        addition to removing the WAR file, this command also removes the
        expanded directory as well. For example, CATALINA_HOME/webapps/search
        directory is removed in addition to CATALINA_HOME/webapps/search.war file.

    ant undeploy war deploy (Tomcat specific)
        runs all three targets in the specified order. Undeploys the last deployment,
        creates a new war file and deploy it again.
