<h1>IntAct project diary</h1>
This "diary" should record, well, significant events in the life of
IntAct, as diaries usually do. In particular, decisions and the
reasoning behind them should be documented. Each entry should have
date and user, and new entries should be added on top.

<dl>
  <dt>2002-04-12, hhe: Relational mapping of polymorphic reference.
  <dd>The the IntAct core model, there is a relationship from
      Substrate to Interactor. Interactor is an abstract class. There
      is no direct way to support polymorphic references in the
      relational model.
      <p>
      I'll try to turn Interactor in a concrete class, and map it and
      all it's subclasses to the same table. This should allow an
      efficient implementation, at the only cost of unused columns in
      the table.

  <dt>2002-04-11, hhe: Oracle implementation: CLOB or LONG?
  <dd>The sequence is a large object, which can exceed Oracle's 4K
      limit for VARCHAR2. I've decided to use the CLOB data type
      because it's 
      <ul>
	<li>is the Oracle-recommended type for large objects,
	<li>offers better direct access to the data than LONG,
	<li>it's the EBI standard to use CLOB for sequences.
      </ul>
      Thanks to Phil McNeil, who provided lots of info to base the
      decision on.
