<h1>Synchroniser notes</h1>

The IntAct software should allow the installation of local nodes
and the propagation of updates to the local data to all partner
sites.
<p>
<h4>Ownership</h4>
To be able to synchronise updates, each data item needs an owner and a
"last updated" timestamp. Only the owner is allowed to update a data
item. A mechanism needs to be set up for the maintenance of controlled
vocabularies.   
<h4>Technology options for database synchronisation</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>Corba
  <dd>Corba technology is still relatively complex to install
      and maintain. Internet-based communication via Corba also
      needs specific ports, which might cause problems with
      firewalls. 
  <dt>Data synchronisation on database level
  <dd>Oracle and other vendors offer proprietary database
      synchronisation technologies. The Oracle version did not
      work too well when tested in the InterPro project. As
      IntAct should be able to use different database backends,
      use of proprietary synchronisation technology would be
      nearly impossible.
	<dt>XML file exchange
	<dd>The favoured synchronisation method is by
	    exchange of XML flat files. We need to be able to dump
	    flat files anyway, so "only" the XML loader would need to be
	    written. If the data is subdivided into
	    <em>datasets</em>, only updated datasets from partner
	    sites need to be loaded. To automatically retrieve
	    datasets, http can be used. 
      </dl>

</ol>
A synchronisation system based on XML files is currently (Aug 2002) under construction.
