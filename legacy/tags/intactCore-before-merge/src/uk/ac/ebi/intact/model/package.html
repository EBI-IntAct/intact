This package is the implementation of the IntAct data model. The IntAct system will be developed in several iterations:
<ul>
<li>IntActTest: Minimal test system to test technical aspects, no real functionality.
<li>IntActCore: System providing core functionality. Classes belonging to this phase are represented in blue.
<li>IntActFull: The full IntAct system. Classes belonging to this phase are represented in yellow.
</ul>

An
