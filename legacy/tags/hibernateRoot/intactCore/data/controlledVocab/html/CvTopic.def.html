<tr><td>term:<td> 3d-r-factors: free R-Factor and working R-Factor for the quality of the crystallographic model
<tr><td>definition:<td> R-factors are measures of the quality of a crystallographic model.
During refinement of a crystal structure a small test set of refinement data may be set aside and used to assess the quality of the refinement process.
The R-factor that is calculated using such a test set of data is the free R-factor whilst the R-factor calculated for the data that is used in refinement is the working R-factor. If no test set was used in refinement, the single, overall R-factor is given.
<tr><td>example:<td> working 24.4%, free 28.4%

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>term:<td> agonist: Activator of an interactor.
<tr><td>definition:<td> Acts on an external cell receptor or other upstream molecule to stimulate a downstream interaction, potentially by modification of one or more of the interactors. For example cells are treated with the agonist IL-2 causing initiation of a kinase cascade and phosphorylation of cellular proteins, leading to interaction formation.

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>term:<td> antagonist: Inactivator of an interactor.
<tr><td>definition:<td> Opposes the effect of a natural ligand by binding at the
same receptor or alters the state of an upstream molecule to inhibit a downstream interaction.
<tr><td>example:<td> An interaction is dependent on a prerequisite phosphorylation of an amino acid, a phosphatase inhibitor e.g. vanadate, will add as an antagonist.

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>term:<td> author-confidence: Confidence classification assigned by the author of the publication

<tr><td>example:<td> In the Giot dataset (giot-2003-ex1), one interaction can have one author-confidence "0.43" and one author-confidence "low", because the authors chose 0.5 as a cutoff for high-confidence interactions.
