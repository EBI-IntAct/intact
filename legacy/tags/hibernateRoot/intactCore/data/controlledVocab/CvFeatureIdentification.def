term: alanine scanning
id: MI:0005
definition: This approach is used to identify the residues that are involved in an interaction. Several variants of the native protein are prepared by mutating each residue of interest to an alanine. The mutated proteins are expressed, tested for proper folding and probed in the binding assay.

term: correlated mutations
id: MI:0026
definition: Pairs of multiple alignments of orthologous sequences are used to identify potential interacting partners as proteins that show covariation of their residue identities between different species. Proteins displaying inter-protein correlated mutations during evolution are likely to be interacting proteins due to co-adapted evolution of their protein interacting interfaces.

term: deletion analysis
id: MI:0033
definition: In this approach, once a protein is demonstrated to participate in an interaction, several deletion derivatives are produced and tested in the binding assay to identify the minimal fragment (domain) that can still support the interaction.

term: docking
id: MI:0035
definition: Predicts the structure of a protein-protein complex from the unbound structures of its components.  The initial approach in the majority of docking procedures is based largely on the 'rigid-body' assumption, whereby the proteins are treated as solid objects. Initial scoring of a complex is based on geometric fit or surface complementarity. This generally requires some knowledge of the binding site to limit the number of solutions.

term: domain profile pairs
id: MI:0037
definition: This approach uses a protein interaction network of a given organism to infer interaction in another organism using information about the interacting region. The regions or domains involved in interactions are clustered if they share sequence similarity and have common interacting partners. The resulting domain profiles are then used to screen the proteome of another organism and domain-domain interactions are inferred. Ultimately, an inferred protein interaction map is built in this second organism.

term: epr: electron paramagnetic resonance
id: MI:0042
definition: EPR (also called ESR, Electron Spin Resonance) spectroscopy is analogous to NMR, but is based on the excitation of unpaired electrons instead of nuclei. Unpaired (single) electrons are only found in radicals and some metal ions (paramagnetic species); the EPR spectrum provides information about the environment and mobility of the paramagnetic species. The magnetic interaction of two paramagnetic centres in a protein can be used to calculate the distance between them; this allows studies of the movements and interactions of protein segments. In proteins without any intrinsic unpaired electrons it is possible to attach a radical probe (spin label). Stable nitroxide radicals can be bound to amino acid residues, in analogy with fluorescent probes. In combination with site directed mutagenesis this method is used in particular to study structure and assembly of membrane proteins, by measuring with EPR whether an amino acid is in a polar or non polar environment.

term: full dna sequence: full identification by sequencing
id: MI:0056
definition: sequencing occurs during the course of the experiment.
The DNA to be sequenced is used as template for the in vitro synthesis, by DNA polymerase, of a set of partial replicas, all beginning at the same place, but terminating at different points along the DNA chain. The key to this method is the use of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in which the deoxyribose 3'-OH group present in normal nucleotides is missing; when such a modified nucleotide is incorporated into a DNA chain, it blocks the elongation of the chain. To determine the full sequence, the four different chain-terminating dideoxyribonucleosides are used in competition with an excess of deoxyribonucleosides in separate DNA synthesis reactions on the same DNA template. When the products of these four reactions are analysed by electrophoresis in four parallel lanes of a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the DNA sequence can be derived. Every lane displays a family of DNA fragments of different lengths, reflecting the different sites at which a specific residue occurs in the original DNA.

term: mobility shift
id: MI:0070
definition: Protein modifications can be identified by gel electrophoresis since any change in the mass and/or the charge of the protein can alter its mobility in PAGE. Although this method does not allow the unequivocally identification of the type of modification that has caused the shift, it is possible, by combining this approach with more direct methods, to correlate the extent of the shift to a specific modification.
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: modified residue ms: mass detection of residue modification
id: MI:0068
definition: Mass spectrometry can be used to characterise chemical modifications within peptides. One approach consists in the observation of a mass difference when a sample is treated with an enzyme that can specifically remove a peptide modification, for instance a phosphatase. The mass difference corresponds to the mass of the chemical group covalently linked to a residue. Such experiments carried out with a MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) do not allow the mapping of the modification site within the sequence, whereas any tandem mass spectrometer (LC MS/MS Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry, nanoESI MS/MS nanoElectrospray Ionisation tandem mass spectrometry, FTMS Fourier Transform mass spectrometry) provide such information. A second approach consists of the direct mass measurement of the ionized chemical group dissociated from the residue within a tandem mass spectrometer. Both approaches need a prior enrichment of the modified peptide population in the samples with IMAC (Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography)or specific anti-modification antibodies.

term: ms protein sequence: de novo protein sequencing by mass spectrometry
id: MI:0032
definition: The strategy to determine the complete amino acid sequence of a protein by mass spectrometry relies on the generation of a nested set of fragments differing by one amino acid. This permits to reveal the identity of the residue that has been removed at each degradation step by measuring the mass difference of fragments differing of one residue. Peptide fragments can be obtained by protease treatment combined with the fragmentation promoted by collision (or other methods) within a tandem mass spectrometer. This approach can be carried out with LC MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry), nanoESI MS/MS (nanoElectrospray Ionisation tandem mass spectrometry), or FTMS (Fourier Transform mass spectrometry) instruments.

definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: nmr: nuclear magnetic resonance
id: MI:0077
definition: NMR requires a small volume of concentrated protein solution that is placed in a strong magnetic field. Certain atomic nuclei, and in particular hydrogen, have a magnetic moment or spin; that is, they have an intrinsic magnetisation, like a bar magnet. The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the protein molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about protein structure and protein-protein interaction.

id: MI:0436
definition: Protein footprinting is a technique for identifying structural changes modulated by protein-ligand binding, and mapping protein-ligand interfaces This technique involves attaching cutting reagents randomly to amino acid residue (e.g. lysine or cysteine) on the proteins surface and then using this lysine-labelled protein to cleave polypeptide backbone of the other protein at exposed residues adjacent to its binding site.

term: protein staining
id: MI:0094
definition: A wide range of dyes have been used over the years to visualise proteins in polyacrylamide gels - Coomasie Blue and silver-staining being two classical methods. Fluorescent dyes such as Nile Red and SYPRO Orange are now increasingly used due to their superior dynamic range. Use of non-denaturing gels can allow visualisation of protein protein interactions. Several dyes can be used to specifically indicate residue modification, however this methodology will give no information as the number of residues modified or their position within the protein sequence. Examples include the use of acid fuscian or the fluorescent dansyl hydrazine to show protein glycosylation.

definition: Method to identify domain-domain interactions  within the same resolved structure. Pfam domains are first projected onto a pdb structure and then the distance between all pairs of residues in different domains are calculated. When the distance between 2 residues is below the non covalent bond threeshold, the corresponding pair of domains is predicted to interact.

term: western blot
id: MI:0113
definition: Western blot is a procedure to identify and quantify proteins. A mixture of protein is first submitted to an electrophoresis in denaturant condition and then electro-transferred from the gel to a membrane. The membrane is then incubated with a primary antibody specific for a given protein or a specific residue modification in the sample under analysis. A secondary antibody, radiolabelled or fused to a chromogenic enzyme, targets the first antibody and allows the visualisation of the protein band on the membrane.

term: x-ray: x-ray crystallography
id: MI:0114
definition: X-rays have a wavelength, typically around 0.1 nm (the diameter of a hydrogen atom). If a narrow parallel beam of X-rays is directed at a sample of a pure protein, most of the X-rays will pass straight through it. A small fraction, however, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample. If the sample is a well-ordered crystal, the scattered waves will reinforce one another at certain points and will appear as diffraction spots when the X-rays are recorded by a suitable detector. The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable protein crystals. This requires high concentration of very pure protein and empirical searching for the proper crystallisation conditions.
