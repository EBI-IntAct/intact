Overview of JUnit for IntactCore.
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this document is to explain the framework required to adopt
JUnit as the testing framework for Intact core Java development work.  The
intention of the document is not to explain the merits of JUnit but rather
how it can be applied to the Intact core development framework.  Click <a
 href="http://www.junit.org">here</a> to read all about JUnit.
</p>I would also like to emphasise that we are dealing specifically with unit
test  cases. A unit test case is a collection of tests designed to verify
the  behavior of a single unit within your program. In Java, the single unit
is almost always a class.  Hence, a Java unit test case tests a single class.
</p>

<h3>Framework</h3>
I suggest that we place all the test related classes in a separate <tt>test</tt>
package.  This practice serves two purposes.  First of all, a package should
only contain package related classes and test classes serve a different
purpose.  Beside, we don't want a package to be cluttered
with test classes.  Also, bear in mind that testing a single class may
involve other classes and resources in addition to the test class itself.
Secondly, we could easily exclude
test related classes in creating a jar file.  The only disadvatage I can envisage
for having a separate test package is that we wouldn't be able to test package
visible class methods.  The same argument goes for protected methods but you
can still create a dummy class in the test package that exposes the protected
method and test this method via the dummy class. Applying the above naming convention,
the test classes to test the package <tt>uk.ac.ebi.intact.model</tt>
must reside in <tt>uk.ac.ebi.intact.model.test</tt> package.
</p>
By convention, each test package should contain a java class called <tt>AllJunitTests</tt>.
The advantage of using a name convention is that it allows us to write
a tool that invokes <tt>AllJUnitTests</tt> class for each test package. Hence,
 we can run all the tests for Intact core with a single
command.
</p>The purpose of the <tt>AllJunitTests</tt> class is to run all the tests for a package.
You can find a template for this class under <a href="AllJUnitTests.java">here</a>.
The method suite() returns a suite of tests to run.  Using this approach,
you have the choice of deciding which test class to include (or exclude) for running.

</p>
A <tt>TestCase</tt>
is a command object and any class that contains test methods should subclass
the <tt>TestCase</tt> class.  A <tt>TestCase</tt> can define any number of public <tt>testXXX()</tt>
methods.  When you want to check the expected and actual test results, you
invoke a variation of the <tt>assert()</tt> method (see JUnit API).  <tt>TestCase</tt> subclasses
that contain multiple <tt>testXXX()</tt> methods can use the <tt>setUp()</tt> and
<tt>tearDown()</tt>
methods to initialize and release any common objects under test, referred
to as the test fixture.  Each test runs in the context of its own fixture,
calling <tt>setUp()</tt> before and <tt>tearDown()</tt> after each test method to ensure there
can be no side effects among test runs.  <tt>TestCase</tt> instances can be composed
into <tt>TestSuite</tt> hierarchies that automatically invoke all the <tt>testXXX()</tt> methods
defined in each <tt>TestCase</tt> instance.  A <tt>TestSuite</tt> is a composite of other tests,
either <tt>TestCase</tt> instances or other <tt>TestSuite</tt> instances.  Using the composite
behavior of <tt>TestSuite</tt>, you can assemble test suites of test suites
and run all the tests automatically. </p>
<h3>Test Classes</h3>
By convention, the test class consists of the same name as the class you are
testing but with <i>Test</i> appended to the name.  For example, the test class
to test <tt>Protein</tt> should be named as <tt>ProteinTest</tt> under <tt>test</tt> subpackage of
<tt>Protein</tt> (ie., <tt>uk.ac.ebi.intact.model.test</tt>).
To write a test case, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Define a subclass of <tt>TestCase</tt>. Name this class according to the naming
  convention.</li>
  <li>Override the <tt>setUp()</tt> method to initialise object(s) under test (<i>optional</i>).</li>
  <li>Override the <tt>tearDown()</tt> method to release object(s) under test (<i>optional</i>).</li>
  <li>Define one or more public <tt>testXXX()</tt> methods that exercise the object(s)
under test and assert expected results.</li>
  <li>Define a static <tt>suite()</tt> factory method that creates a <tt>TestSuite</tt> instance.</li>
  <li>See <a href="FirstTest.java">FirstTest</a> for a sample.</li>
</ol>

To write a test suite, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Define a subclass of <tt>TestCase</tt>.</li>
<li>Define a static <tt>suite()</tt> factory method that creates a TestSuite containing
all the tests.</li>
<li>See <a href="AllJUnitTests.java">AllJUnitTests</a> for a sample.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Supporting Tools</h3>
We may need supporting tools as we begin to write more tests.  For example,
a test method may require to compare two text files for their contents (did the
program generate the expected output?).  Instead of replicating the code
to compare two files in various test classes, we should have a class (or a method) to
do this task.  A package called <tt>testing</tt> under <tt>uk.ac.ebi.intact.util</tt>
is a possible location to place these tools.  It is called <tt>testing</tt>
to distinguish it from <tt>test</tt> packages.  As these tools are only required for
testing purposes, we could easily omit them from creating a jar file by instructing
it to avoid packages starting with <tt>test</tt>.
