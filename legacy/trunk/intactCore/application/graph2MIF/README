README for Graph2MIF (intactCore/application/Graph2MIF)
**********************************************************************

DIRECTORIES:
/ (root)        : Graph2MIF.wsdd, build.xml
WEB-INF/lib     : Library files for web. All the files in this location are
                  included in the WAR file.
WEB-INF/classes : Graph2MIF specific (non Intact core) class files.
WEB-INF/config  : Configuration/Property files for the application.
dist/           : Where the WAR file is created.
doc/            : the API of the classes will be created here

INSTALLATION
    edit repository.xml and OJB.properties in the intact root directory
    (intactCore/config) to suit your requirements (oracle vs postgres etc).
    Instead of editing these files manually, you may just run ant set-target-env
    from intactCore directory. The target environment is specified in the
    build.properties file (intactCore directory). CvEdit has been tested
    under Oracle 8.1.6 and PostGres 7.2 (local and remote).

NOTE
    BEWARE that if the logging feature isn't set to ERROR,
    it will desacrease considerably the response time of the application.
    Up to now, even the WARN level is generating a huge load of log.
    cf. the file $INTACT_CORE/config/log4j.properties (section graph2mif).

BUILD
    ant war
        prepares a WAR file to be deployed in a WEB container. The WAR file is
        created in the dist/ directory.

OTHER USEFUL COMMANDS
    ant console
	    compiles the console example Graph2MIFConsole to ../../classes, which
		can rerieve a MIF document and print it to STDOUT.

    ant run-console
	    starts the console programm and retrieves a MIF Document of the interactor and depth
		specified at the top of build.xml ( ${test-ac}, ${test-depth} & ${test-strictmif} )

    ant wsclient
	    compiles the example client Graph2MIFWSClient to ../../classes, which
		can rerieve a MIF document and print it to STDOUT.

    ant run-wsclient
	    starts the client and retrieves a MIF Document of the interactor and depth
		specified at the top of build.xml

	ant clean
		deletes temp-web and temp-doc. Also deletes the API-documentation.

	ant clean-all
	    like clean - but also deletes the compiled clients.

	ant doc
	    creates API of all classes to ./doc
    ant deploy (Tomcat specific)
        deploys the WAR file in the dist/ location to the CATALINA_HOME/webapps. The
        environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for this command to work
        correctly.

    ant undeploy (Tomcat specific)
        reverses the effects of 'ant deploy' command. In addition to that, this
        command also stops the WEB server (Tomcat) if it is running. As with
        deploy command, the environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for
        this command to work correctly. An error message, displayed when trying
        to shutdown the WEB server if it is not running, can be safely ignored. In
        addition to removing the WAR file, this command also removes the
        expanded directory as well. For example, CATALINA_HOME/webapps/Graph2MIFWS
        directory is removed in addition to CATALINA_HOME/webapps/Graph2MIFWS.war file.

    ant undeploy war deploy (Tomcat specific)
        runs all three targets in the specified order. Undeploys the last deployment,
        creates a new war file and deploy it again.


NOTES
    The WAR file is being built using jar and class file from various locations.
    Given below are locations where it looks for these files:
        / (root)        - Graph2MIF.wsdd (will be proceeded to server-config.wsdd)
        WEB-INF/        - web.xml
        WEB-INF/lib     - all the jar files in this location.
        ../../dist/     - intact-core.jar file.
        ../../lib       - application common jar files (only a subset).
		../../classes   - client will be compiled to this directory
        WEB-INF/classes - Graph2MIF class files.
