This package contains the helper class which allows clients to access the business tier
for intact. Specifically the {@link uk.ac.ebi.intact.business.IntactHelper} class provides the core functionality
of creation and search, and this class in turn access the business layer via the use of a
 Data Access Object (DAO) interface for obtaining connections, managing transactions and so
 on.
<p>
The <code>IntactHelper</code> class also provides a method to obtain the nearest neighbour
objects of a given object, thereby avoiding the overhead of a database connection when it
is known that only the nearest neighbours are required. As mentioned elsewhere, these are
automatically loaded into memory for each individual object search in order to optimise
castor lazy loading. The searching itself is managed with the help of a map of simple intact
classnames to full java classnames, which allows other objects (such as the {@link uk.ac.ebi.intact.persistence.DAO}
object) to build approrpriate object queries. The map itself is provided to the <code>ItactHelper</code>
class upon instance creation.
