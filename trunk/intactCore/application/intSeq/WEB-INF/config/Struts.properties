srs.search.status=The search string was not found in the IntAct database.

srs.todo.query=Please reformulate your query, or use the

srs.details.explanation=The search string you have entered was not found in the IntAct database. The <i>SRS search</i> will search for the string you have entered in the complete Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL protein database. Entries in which your query occurs will be returned to you.

srs.details.todo=You can then select one of these entries and run a sequence similarity search against all entries in IntAct. If successful, this will return entries which are homologs of your protein of interest.

srs.details.particular.result=If the SRS search retrieves only a single entry, the sequence similarity search will be launched directly.

srs.result.page.presentation=The SRS search has found several results.

srs.results.todo=Please choose one of these SPTr entries and the <i>sequence similarity search</i> will look for the most similar IntAct entries:

srs.details.process=The accession number you will select allows to retrieve the corresponding fasta sequence, and then, the <i>sequence similarity search</i> runs this sequence against the whole Intact database.

srs.details.forward=You will be forwarded to the result page of the <i>sequence similarity search</i>.
