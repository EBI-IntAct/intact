                IntAct is a protein interaction database and analysis system. It
                provides a query interface and modules to analyse interaction
                data. This manual describes the IntAct data structure and the
                components of the IntAct system.

                    One interaction object represents the complex of the alpha, beta, and gamma
                    chains which form the receptor. This interaction object is the used in the
                    second interaction object, in which the binding of Interleukin 2 to the
                    receptor is represented. Both Interaction objects are linked to an experiment,
                    in which the Interaction has been determined.

                        An Interactor describes an "abstract" form of e.g. a protein,
                        similar to a description in a protein sequence database. One
                        protein can participate in many interactions. To describe the
                        specific conditions in which an Interactor participates in an
                        Interaction, the following additional attributes are used:

                                the role "prey".

                        An Interactor is normally a protein. However, to model
                        hierarchical assemblies of complexes from subcomplexes, an
                        Interactor can also be an Interaction.
                        <br/>
                        Example: To model a receptor-ligand interaction, the receptor
                        could be modeled by an interaction which describes the composition
                        of the receptor from its component proteins. Then, in another
                        Interaction, the association of receptor and ligand would be
                        described. See the

                <section title="Basic Overview" name="search.Overview">

                    <blockquote>
                        The search application currently allows a text-based search by entering
                        a text string into the search text box. It is possible to obtain information
                        on experiments, protein interactions and the proteins themselves, with
                        various views used to display the data. Intact uses the concept of
                        <a href="#AnnotatedObject.shortLabel"> short
                            label </a> which is intended to provide a way of 'more memorable identification'
                        compared to an
                        <a href="#AnnotatedObject.ac"> accession number (ac) </a> , although searches by ac are
                        obviously allowed. For example a particular Experiment may have an ac of
                        EBI-14, but its name is 'gavin' indicating a more meaningful reference
                        to the physical experiment which the entry represents. Basic points on
                        usage:

                        <ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Wildcard searching is supported - for example matches will be retrieved
                                    for strings such as EBI*, *BI-14, E*4, etc etc.</li>

                                <li>
                                    upper or lower case strings are acceptable (but not mixed case) and will be matched if they
                                    exist. The exception to this is a search by alias (ie gene name, as defined in
                                    Swisprot) - currently these
                                    are stored as lower case and are searched for as such. This will become more sophisiticated
                                    as the project matures.</li>

                                <li>
                                    currently searches progress in a certain order: proteins, then interactions,
                                    then experiments. At a lower level, specific attributes are searched by
                                    AC, short label, alias (gene name), Xref primary ID and finally full name. </li>

                                <li>
                                    Note that whilst CvObject details can be displayed via the click of a link,
                                    currently it is not possible to search for CvObjects via the text box search
                                    entry point.</li>

                            this time there are too many interactions to display it in one go. So, the Experiment is splited in several pages
                            that you can reach using the index above the Experiment.
                            <br/>
                            This is shown below:

                            <a NAME="binary.view"></a>Protein views can be of various types. Searching for a protein will result in a so-called
                            'binary view'. This view shows the list of proteins which are in a pairwise interaction with the searched-for protein.
                            An example result screen for this view is shown below:

                            <a NAME="interaction.details.view"></a>Viewing the interactions for a particular protein can also be done from the binary view - an
                            example screen displayed by clicking on the 'view 1 interaction' link is shown below:

                            the database identified with a name of 'SPTR'. The screen looks
                            like this:

                            has a term in brackets (eg '[p]') which denotes the role that the protein
                            plays in the interaction. These terms have tooltips associated with them
                            to display the role name, and also the term is a clickable link from which
                            you can view the full details of the controlled vocabulary term which presents
                            the controlled vocabulary information for that term (eg the details held
                            to define the meaning of the term 'bait').
                        </p>
                        <p>Since the items displayed for a search result include many items not
                            actually queried for, the items that matched the oringinal search string

                            the *names* of the matching items are highlighted, since these are
                            always displayed in every view.
                        </p>
                        <p>Where a protein (for example) might actually occur more than once in
                            an experiment, the display is rationalised to avoid multiple presentations
                            of the same experiment - therefore all occurrences within an experiment
                            are gathered together into one experiment view.</p>

                        The user must select the type to edit from the drop down list (defaults
                        to the first item in the list if none specified).

                        The input field under the drop down list accepts the search criteria.
                        The search is performed first on accession number (ac), and then on
                        name, primary id and full name respectively. So, it is faster to
                        search by an accession number than by a name.

                        You can accept the default search value (*) by simply clicking on the
                        search button. This may take some time depending on the database size as
                        it retrieves all records for a given IntAct type. However, you can also
                        use more restrictive filtering such as EBI-3* to restrieve a subset of
                        records. The following screen provides an example to this.

                        matching records. Click on the AC link to edit individual entry.
                        Alternatively, you can enter the name directly in the search box
                        and it will take you to the edit screen if a matching record wasn't
                        found for a given name and type as shown below.

                        The search is carried out against the object type selected in the drop down list. So, ensure that you
                        correctly select the type first before the search.

                            results in a server side validation. The error response from the server

                            Although both validations are similar in nature, they serve two
                            different purposes. The first validation is performed on the client side
                            (browser) and hence faster of the two. However, the browser must be
                            enabled to accept Javascript for it to work (no dialog window if
                            Javascript is not enabled). This is the preferred validation as it saves
                            extra step in communication with the server. Alternatively, the other
                            validation is not dependent on Javascript and hence works on
                            any browser. However, it is slow since it involves a round trip to the
                            server.

                            For a name to be valid it must be syntactically correct and
                            unique (i.e, no simlar label for the current edit type exists in the
                            database). All the existing short lables for the current edit types are
                            shown along with an error message for a non unique name entry.

                                appropriate values for search fields. Only the most specific value
                                is taken into consideration if multiple values are provided for search.
                                Since IntAct AC is the most specific, other search values are ignored
                                if a value was specified for IntAct AC.
                                <br/>
                                If a search is performed by UniProt accession number (SP AC), and no matching protein is found, the editor will access an external server, by default the EBI SRS server, to retrieve the corresponding protein,

                                'color coded' Proteins do not form part of the current Interaction until
                                the user save them by selecting 'Save' button.

                                It is an error to add two identical Proteins with similar role. As
                                illustrated in the above example, Protein ABD1 already exists as a bait
                                of the Interaction and adding ABD1 again as a bait caused the
                                above error. The only alternative in this instance is to assign a
                                different role (other than bait) for the new Protein.

                        <b>What browsers Editor supports?
                            <br/>
                        </b>It has been tested using Mozilla (1.4a), Explorer (6.0) and
                        Konqueror (2.1.1 or above). With the Konqueror it has been noted that
                        pop up windows do not get the focus (need to bring them manually). Also,
                        the footer is almost at the top when a page does not contain much
                        information.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        <b>Do I need a JRE installed to run the Editor?</b>
                        <br/>
                        No, you don't need Java Runtime to run the Editor as it is designed to
                        run on thin clients (see the next question about JavaScript).
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        <b>Do I need JavaScript to run the Editor?</b>
                        <br/>
                        No, but it helps a lot. For example, some validations such as short
                        label syntax are faster as they are peformed via JavaScript. Also, the
                        links to pop up windows wouldn't work when JavaScript is not enabled.
                        However, the overall functionality of the Editor shouldn't be affected
                        if JavaScript is not enabled.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        <b>Do I need to logout when I am finished?</b>
                        <br/>
                        There is no need to logout because your session will timeout if it has
                        been inactive for 30 or more minutes. However, by explicitly logging out
                        you are releasing the resources (good thing to do). So, we recommend
                        explicit logouts.
                        <br/>

                        <b>Can I connect to my last session when
                            my session expires?</b>
                        <br/>
                        No. Once your session expires you need to login again and this in turn
                        will start a new session.

                        As far as the system is concerned it remembers the value associated
                        with the last 'Save' action. Since you pressed 'Save' after 'abc' but
                        not after 'ab%', it has already assigned 'abc' as the name. In a
                        nut shell, it is not even aware of 'ab%' because it hasn't seen it.

              <blockquote>
                Uncovering the interactome is one of the primary challenges in the post-genomic era. The topology information gained from the coverage of interaction space can shed light on the likely function and structure of proteins within the network (Vitkup et al, 2001). Here we present a list of the 'best baits' which give the highest return on experimental effort - i.e. those proteins which form 'hubs' in the interaction network. These lists are generated using the Pay-As-You-Go strategy (Lappe, M. Holm, L.(2004) Nature Biotechnology 22, pp 98 - 103) which detects and prioritises those proteins which have the highest likelihood of being hubs based on the current data within IntAct for various species. To illustrate the experimental effort which could be saved by using the strategy recommended here, take the Human interactome as an example. It is estimated that 50,000 experiments would be required to cover the entire human interactome following a purely random strategy for the selection of targets. The information gain here is close to linear for each experiment. This could be drastically reduced to less than 10,000 for 90% coverage of the entire human interactome by using the proteins listed here as baits. This would save years of experimental effort. This of course relies on the timely deposition of experimental data into the IntAct database in order that the Pay-As-You-Go algorithm should be fully uptodate and effective.

            <blockquote>To ensure data consistency, IntAct makes intensive use of controlled vocabularies. All controlled vocabularies are available in Gene Ontology DAG-Edit format and HTML format, see the <a href="#download">download</a> section. Where the IntAct controlled vocabularies are identical to the <a href="http://psidev.sf.net/">PSI MI consortium</a> controlled vocabularies, only links to the PSI MI web site are given. Some IntAct annotation of controlled vocabulary terms does not fit the GO DAG-Edit format, but as we want to export all available information, some comments might have to be filtered out from the *.def files before editing them in GO DAG-Edit.
