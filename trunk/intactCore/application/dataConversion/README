Notes for the PSI Generator
------------------------------------------

To Build it
---------------
Assuming you have already run ant compile-core to build the core files, cd to application/dataConversion. Then just type

	ant compile

to generate the classes directory. This will also copy the jar files from the lib directory of IntactCore, depending upon which 
DB you have set to access (either postgres or oracle).


To Run it
-------------
Assuming you have the usual things set up for Intact, simply type

	scripts/psiRun.sh FileGenerator <filename>

from the top level directory (ie from IntactCore). The <filename> parameter is simply the name of the XML file that you wish to use for 
the results.
