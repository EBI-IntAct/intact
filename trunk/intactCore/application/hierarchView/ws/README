wsdd/            : deployment and undeployment files.
wsdl/            : description of the web service.
build.xml        : Ant build file which contains target to install and manage the web service.
ws.properties    : contains properties needed to install the web service.
tulipService.jar : the web service library (need to be install under Axis).


PREREQUISITES
--------------
To install and run the intact software you must have the following installed in your
environment (or, for the DBs, at least have access to them over the network):

	- java JDK 1.4
	  see http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html
	- ant 1.5 or above (all the intact build process relies on ant)
	  see http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
	- Tomcat Light Edition, for JDK 1.4 (preferably 4.1.1.8 LE)
      see http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/release/v4.1.18/bin/
	- Apache Axis web application (1.0) for web services (for use with the HierarchView application)
	  see http://ws.apache.org/axis/
	  We advice to use Axis 1.3 which has been tested thoroughly
	      you can get it from: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/ws/axis/1_3
	  It is planned to update to a more recent version of Axis.

    [ Layout library: GVF(provided) or Tulip ]

    - Graph Visualization Library
      see http://gvf.sourceforge.net/
      GVF is part of the distribution and the library will be automatically included if you have
      choosen to use it when you built the web service archive.

	- Tulip (available from Labri in Bordeaux),
	  see http://www.tulip-software.org/
      Note that Tulip needs the following environment variables to be set :
         TLPDIR=<location of the main tulip directory>
         LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:TLPDIR/lib
         QTDIR=<location of the QT directory>
         LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$QTDIR/lib
	- The console binary (needed to interract with Tulip) file has to be put in the location
	  described in the application/hierarchView/WEB-INF/config/WebService.properties


INSTALLATION NOTES
-------------------
By following the steps below, we will install the tulip web service on that machine.

(1) Customize the properties file (ws.properties)
     - webService.port : the port number of the Tomcat server which host your web service
     - axis.dir        : the path of your Axis installation
                         usually, <TOMCAT_PATH>/webapps/axis

(2) Intall the web service
    type 'ant deploy', it copy needed files on Axis.

(3) Restart Tomcat
    The web service is now ready to be started.

WEB SERVICE MANAGEMENT  (after deployment)
-----------------------

* Start the web service (please read the note below)
  type 'ant start'
  Now the web service is ready to receive client request.

* Stop the web service
  type 'ant stop'



Note: In order to compute the coordinates, you might be using either Tulip (C++ based) or
----  the Graph Visualization Framework (Java based).
      In order to find out which implementation has been selected, you can edit the file:

           wsdd/deploy.wsdd

      and check which implementation will be used when deploying the web service.

      If you are using Tulip, you should find:

        <service name="tulip" provider="java:RPC">
            <parameter name="className"
                       value="uk.ac.ebi.intact.application.hierarchView.business.tulip.webService.TulipAccessImpl"/>
            ( ... )
        </service>


      If you are using GSF, you should find:

        <service name="tulip" provider="java:RPC">
            <parameter name="className"
                       value="uk.ac.ebi.intact.application.hierarchView.business.tulip.webService.GVFImpl"/>
            ( ... )
        </service>

      Bear in mind that both implementations are embedded in the web service, starting the web service (ant start)
      will select one of them according to the content of the deploy.wsdd file.
