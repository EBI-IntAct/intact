	- have to be done
	+ currently under progress





- Add licence in files it's missing.

- Find a way to check if a web service is currently running (in the runtime)
  test could be done when a new user is lauching the first page !

+ Check if the current use of Struts couldn't be improved
  + refactoring the package architecture
  - Storing the ActionBean instead of each data separetly
  - take advantage of Struts 1.1 to remove all Form and let Struts generate ans manage them.

+ Contact David Binns to go on colaboration
  + mail sent on 29.1.2003 to ask for a talk
  - See the current state of Interpro and how it's possible to integrate our features

+ See with Florian Iragne (forian.iragne@labri.fr, Bordeaux)
   + Test the Turender web service
   + Definition of the future web service interface
   + implementation of a basic web service to begin test

+ SVG integration 
  + SVG producing (batik)
  + SVG displaying (batik, CSIRO applet)
  - SVG handling (real zoom, panning, text searching, centering via URL ...)

+ Work on the SVG applet
   - create or reuse an existing one (CSIRO, Batik) 
   - features
   - size

	Q: My applets are big and it takes much time to download (on 
	browser) when a network is slow.
	Is there any way to decrease the start up time?

	Answer: The good solution is to make a small core .jar file that
	contains part applet that is necessary to start it up (initial 
	GUI elements) and rest of classes can be loaded later when applet
	is already running. Nobody use 100 % of functionality directly 
	and will give an impression that everything is ready... :-) 
	This solution is good due to another reason also. If browser lost
	connection during loading of one big .jar file you need to start 
	everything from scratch. If it happens with our solution browser 
	will cash part of classes and it will save time for reloading!

	Usually you don?t need all the functionality of the applet at 
	once, so the applet can operate before all of its possible 
	functionality is downloaded. And .jar and .class files does get
	cached by most browsers. 

- solve browser behaviour problem
	o Netscape, remove frames

- checkbox with struts.
  Maybe to store the bean in the session ?!

- If an error occurs during the highlightment process,
  the error is not caught currently and so, not reported in the Struts Level.
  So the user is not warned ! It seems that no GO term are found.
  cf. HighlightProteins when it call proteinToHighlight ()


WAIT FOR INTEGRATION IN BORDEAUX ...

+ Update libraries :
   - Installing the latest stable release of Axis

- add logging facilities in the web service

- Add some Graph properties :
  - Color of highlighted and non highlighted proteins
  - Color of selected (the one given in the form) and non selected proteins
  - Cventually boldness of them all

+ in the startup create a logger object and put it in the context to allow better tracing.
  + a logger is configured in an init Servlet and the logger can be accessed via a static method
    from every classes.

(05.02.2003)
+ Detect during the Build process if every configuration file have been customized
  if not don't allow to build a war and display a meaningfull message.
  + In WebService.properties
    + console location
    + web service hostname
  + In Highlighting.properties
    + interpro hostname

(05.02.2003)
+ create a custom tag which redirect to the index page if something is not well set (datasource, web service)

(04.02.2003)
+ put in a properties file the hostname of the interpro application !
  cf. GOHighlightmentSource.java

(04.02.2003)
+ Improve the web service managment by deploying it in the run time.

(03.02.2003)
+ IntAct software workshop notes
  + Hierarchview: Database timeouts
  + Hierarchview: limited number of connections need to be caught.

+ Create a Custom Tag to initialize the session at startup of the application
  + Store in the session an IntactHelper (cf. Sugath) to solve the current
    data access problem. CRASH after 12 submission of highlight form.
  + Clean the rest of the application to make use the IntactHelper stored in the session.

+ Update libraries :
    + Install Struts 1.1 and check if everything ok

+ write an Ant task to undeploy the web service

+ put in every source package  'package.html' file which describe that package !

+ Write an ant task to test if the web service is properly running

+ Write an installation note
   + cf intactCore/application/hierarchView/README

+ Remove all internal links in Interpro
  + modifying the simple.xsl file to customize our displaying (given to David Binns)

+ Presents to Sugath the new architecture to generate picture !
  generate svg and the servlet build on the fly the image according to parameters (format ...)

+ Tomcat jar problem :
  We have to add xercesImpl.jar (found in the WEB-INF/lib of our web application) in the
  $CATALINA_HOME/common/lib. It was not used when the jar file was in our application directory.
  This jar is needed because org.w3c.dom.DOMErrorHandler class is used when tomcat launch our application
  -> Do not occur with Jakarta-Tomcat4.1.18-LE-jdk1.4

+ building a script allowing to do the tedious task of managing the web service !

+ create then an external build.xml for hierarchView

+ interact with EGO (e.g. GOTerm.isAParent(GOTerm))
   + take over with Sugath
   + make meet Sugath and David Binns

+ take over the application with Sugath
  + overview of the application
  + how to play with the web service
  + image processing
  + highlighting process

+ Modify the SVG generation class to fit the improvement of the drawing process (GraphToImage)
  + test it !

+ no depth limit (see hhe)

- implement the option of GoHighlightmentSource to use the list of GO terms (children)

- Document the way to launch the Tomcat server by taking care to run properly a new X server in the same window
  Xvfb :2.0 &
  setenv DISPLAY :2.0
  (run Tomcat)

- Allows the web service to send error message

- update jsp/hierarchView/tulip/scripts/startService.sh with right messages
  don't speak anymore about 'Serveur' unless Bordeaux solve that problem !

- add some comments in properties files with #

- update INTACTCORE/build.xml with the description flag to make some target visible from
  ant -projecthelp

- write a proper test directory for the web service
  jsp/hierarchView/tulip/script.test

- cleaning the web.xml to avoid Tomcat exception in its startup

- Correcting the displaying if the interaction network :
	o label out of the image range

- give a meaning for each displayed GO term in the right frame.

- get a list of GO term from AC in the IntAct database

- put under CVS source code of cli, Serveur and console.

- Allow to read dinamically (in runtime) the URL of the Web Service, instead to have this hardcoded in the 
  following class :
  uk.ac.ebi.intact.application.hierarchView.business.tulip.client.generated.TulipAccessServiceLocator.java
  Maybe by reading a property file and editing the generated code !

- option of the highlightment source
