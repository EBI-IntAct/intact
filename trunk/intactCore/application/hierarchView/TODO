- Is there a way to get log4j to automatically reload a configuration file if it changes?
  Yes. Both the DOMConfigurator and the PropertyConfigurator support automatic reloading
  through the configureAndWatch APIs. See the API documentation for more details.

+ Look for solving Oracle driver problem
  + contact dbinns (no idea)
  - forwarded to dba ... waiting from 10.02.2003

+ See with Florian Iragne (forian.iragne@labri.fr, Bordeaux)
   + Test the Turender web service : not that reliable ... often unavailable.
   + Definition of the future web service interface
   + implementation of a basic web service to begin test

+ SVG integration
  + SVG producing (batik)
  + SVG displaying (batik, CSIRO applet)
  - SVG handling (real zoom, panning, text searching, centering via URL ...)

+ Work on the SVG applet
   - create or reuse an existing one (CSIRO, Batik)
   - features
   - size

	Q: My applets are big and it takes much time to download (on
	browser) when a network is slow.
	Is there any way to decrease the start up time?

	Answer: The good solution is to make a small core .jar file that
	contains part applet that is necessary to start it up (initial
	GUI elements) and rest of classes can be loaded later when applet
	is already running. Nobody use 100 % of functionality directly
	and will give an impression that everything is ready... :-)
	This solution is good due to another reason also. If browser lost
	connection during loading of one big .jar file you need to start
	everything from scratch. If it happens with our solution browser
	will cash part of classes and it will save time for reloading!

	Usually you don?t need all the functionality of the applet at
	once, so the applet can operate before all of its possible
	functionality is downloaded. And .jar and .class files does get
	cached by most browsers.

- solve browser behaviour problem
	o Netscape, remove frames

- If an error occurs during the highlightment process,
  the error is not caught currently and so, not reported in the Struts Level.
  So the user is not warned ! It seems that no GO term are found.
  cf. HighlightProteins when it call proteinToHighlight ()


WAIT FOR INTEGRATION IN BORDEAUX ...

+ Update libraries :
   - Installing the latest stable release of Axis

- add logging facilities in the web service






====================================
              D O N E
====================================

+ Selected protein have a bold label

+ InGO integration
  + InGO modifications :
    + Url creation :
       + david has modified inGO in that way :
         http://localhost/ingo/ego/DisplayGoTerm?selected=GO:0005635,GO:0005637&intact=true&format=contentonly
         the intact parameter allows to use a dedicated JSP page which remove all internal link !
       + we still have to integrate two parameters in order to target back properly to hierarchView :
         + application URL (on which inGO concatenate a list of GO terms)
         + frame name


(18.03.2003)
Fix the IntactAppender in order to avoid to add n time the username at the end of the logging filename.
So, give a second parameter: $username which is replaced by the current username.
The user is free to use it.

(17.03.2003)


(14.03.2003)
+ finish to implements the new hierarchView layout (intact common to all apps)

(28.02.2003)
+ in order to support the host name in the logging file path, write our own log4j appender
  which support the $hostname option the the FileAppender.File property.

(26.02.2003)
+ put frames name as constants

(26.02.2003)
+ checkbox with struts.
  Maybe to store the bean in the session ?!
  -> modifying the scope of the visualize option to session.

(25.02.2003)
+ preparing logging strategy for Intact web application
  + shared log4j.properties file (1 log file by application)
  + new scripts which allows to set every system variables (JAVA_OPTS needed)
  + creating a powerpoint to explain during the IntAct meeting

(25.02.2003)
+ InGO integration
  + InGO use : (corrected by david)
    + No image produced (EBI-195 -> GO:0005758):
        http://web7-node1.ebi.ac.uk:9280/ingo/ego/DisplayGoTerm?id=GO:0005758&format=contentonly
    + no active MAP ... currently 2 MAP are produced : one called graphzone (which contained data)
      and an other (without data). And the hierarchy image is using the empty one.
      May be an option exists to activate the MAP ?
  + InGO modification (by david)
      + Customize JSP (finally did by David)
      + if tag to display intact part
      + add needed parameters to <i:gohierarchy ...> tag : URL, targetFrameName

(25.02.2003)
+ Check if the current use of Struts couldn't be improved
  + refactoring the package architecture
  + Storing the ActionBean instead of each data separetly
    -> finally storing every user data in the IntactUser (+ getters and setters)

(24.02.2003)
+ BUG : when a database connection timeout occured, no way to use hierarchView, even if
        the intactHelper has been close (.closeStore()). When a new intactHelper is created,
        the database is still unavailable.
  + MUST find a way to check if the connection is still open (not needed anymore).
  + How to very close data access (helper.closeStore seems to do the job now)

+ Find a way to check if a web service is currently running (in the runtime)
  test could be done when a new user is lauching the first page !
  + Add that method to WebServiceManager (boolean returned), it will
    be used in the InitTag to check in case the manager is in the session is
    the web service is running.
    Write a dummy method (isRunning) in the web service (which return a Bolean) and try
    to catch an exception
    -> is something is throws ... try to start the WS again !
  + It possible to know if it's properly working by catching the java.rmi.RemoteException !

(11.02.2003)

  + modifying the simple.xsl file to customize our displaying (given to David Binns)

+ Presents to Sugath the new architecture to generate picture !
  generate svg and the servlet build on the fly the image according to parameters (format ...)

+ Tomcat jar problem :
  We have to add xercesImpl.jar (found in the WEB-INF/lib of our web application) in the
  $CATALINA_HOME/common/lib. It was not used when the jar file was in our application directory.
  This jar is needed because org.w3c.dom.DOMErrorHandler class is used when tomcat launch our application
  -> Do not occur with Jakarta-Tomcat4.1.18-LE-jdk1.4

  (run Tomcat)

+ Allows the web service to send error message

+ update jsp/hierarchView/tulip/scripts/startService.sh with right messages
  don't speak anymore about 'Serveur' unless Bordeaux solve that problem !

+ add some comments in properties files with #

+ update INTACTCORE/build.xml with the description flag to make some target visible from
  ant -projecthelp

+ write a proper test directory for the web service
  jsp/hierarchView/tulip/script.test

+ cleaning the web.xml to avoid Tomcat exception in its startup

+ Correcting the displaying if the interaction network :
	o label out of the image range

+ give a meaning for each displayed GO term in the right frame.

+ get a list of GO term from AC in the IntAct database

+ put under SVN source code of cli, Serveur and console.

+ Allow to read dinamically (in runtime) the URL of the Web Service, instead to have this hardcoded in the
  following class :
  uk.ac.ebi.intact.application.hierarchView.business.tulip.client.generated.TulipAccessServiceLocator.java
  Maybe by reading a property file and editing the generated code !

+ option of the highlightment source
