INSTALLATION NOTES
------------------

The command line 'Ant -projecthelp' allows you to have the description of
needed Ant task to install hierarchView.

In the following part, I will consider that :
   - the intactCore database access is already properly configured (cf. intactCore/README)
   - the Tulip software had been installed (www.tulip-software.org)
   - a gcc 2.96 compiler is available on you system
     it will allows to compile the command line tulip access software.
   - you have already a proper installation of Tomcat (jakarta.apache.org/tomcat)
   - you have already a proper installation of Axis (xml.apache.org/axis/)
   - you have Interpro properly running on your tomcat server




(1) Compile the intactCore
    ----------------------
    go in the intactCore directory (root of the project) and run 'ant compile-all'.


(2) Install the tulip console
    -------------------------
    - in the 'tulip' directory, you will find the 'tulipRemote-scr.tar.gz' archive.
    - Uncompress it.
    - it creates a 'Serveur' directory in which you will have firstly to customize
      the 'configure' script.
      You find there also 'HELP.intact' file which explain how to customize 'configure'.
    - run it (./configure) to create the 'Makefile'.
    - run it (make)
    - You obtain 'console' binary file you have now to copy in a location of your
      choice. That file will be used by the web service to accessed the Tulip
      library.


(3) Configure and deploy the Tulip web service
    ------------------------------------------
    - edit the 'WEB-INF/config/WebService.properties' file.
    - customize :
        * 'webService.adress' with the url of your Axis installation.
        * 'webService.console.location' with the absolute path to the console you
          have compiled.
     - run 'Ant deploy-ws', will generate needed file and deploy the web service on
      your Axis installation


(4) set your Linux X11 system
    -------------------------
    Before to start tomcat, you have to start a new X server to allow
    hierarchView to access the display layer of the current system.
    In the terminal you want to start Tomcat, you have to do the following tasks :

	    Xvfb :2.0 &        (or an other port if it's already in use)
	    setenv DIPLAY :2.0 (to point on the new X server)
	    echo $DISPLAY      (just to check)


(5) Build the application war file
    ------------------------------
    run 'ant undeploy war deploy', will clean Tomcat and install the web application.


(6) Start Tomcat
    ------------
    run 'ant start-tomcat'


(5) Start the web service
    ---------------------
    run 'ant start-ws', will make become the tulip web service available.
    You can test if the web service is properly running by running 'ant test-ws', you should
    get the sended TLP content and the returned list of protein's coordinates.


(6) Try the web application
    -----------------------
    let's open a browser and go to http://[YOU_WEB_SERVER]/hierarchView
