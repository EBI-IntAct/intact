In order to have a nive display in your web application, you should read the following lines ;o)

Before to start tomcat, you have to start a new X server to allow 
hierarchView to access the display layer of the current system.

In the terminal you want to start Tomcat, you have to do the following tasks :

	Xvfb :2.0 &
	setenv DIPLAY :2.0 (to give an adress in DIPLAY for the server X, DISPLAY is used by tomcat)
	echo $DISPLAY (just to check)
