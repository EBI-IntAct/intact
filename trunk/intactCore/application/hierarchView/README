INSTALLATION NOTES
------------------

The command line 'ant -projecthelp' allows you to get the available list of
Ant task to install hierarchView.


PART 0 : PREPARE THE INTACTCORE
-------------------------------
cf. README file in the intactCore root directory.



PART 1 : INSTALL THE TULIP WEB SERVICE
---------------------------------------
That web service will allows hierarchView to calculate proteins' coordinates of the
interaction network to display. It can either be based on Tulip or the
Graph Visualization Framework, the user will be asked which one as to be used when
building the web service.


(1) Configure the Tulip web service
    -------------------------------
    - edit the 'WEB-INF/config/WebService.properties' file.
    - customize :
        * webService.adress             : with the url of your tulip web service

        [ properties below are only needed by tulip, hence skip it if you have choosen GVF ]
        * webService.console.location   : with the absolute path to the console you have compiled in step 1.
        * webService.tlpRepository.path : with the path of a writable directory (default /tmp).


(2) Build the web service archive
    -----------------------------

    type 'ant make-ws'
    At the prompt, choose which layout library you want to use (Tulip or GVF).
    It creates an archive called tulipWebService.tar.gz in the 'dist' directory.


[ If you have choosen the GVF library, please go to (4) ]


(3) Install the tulip console (software allowing to interact with the Tulip library)
    -------------------------
    - in the 'tulip' directory, you will find the 'tulipRemote-scr.tar.gz' archive.
    - Uncompress it.
    - it creates a 'Serveur' directory in which you will have firstly to customize
      the 'configure' script.
      You find there also 'HELP.intact' file which explain how to customize 'configure'.
    - run it (./configure) to create the 'Makefile'.
    - run it (make)
    - You obtain 'console' binary file you have now to copy in a location of your
      choice (on the machine which will run the web service).


(4) Install the web service
    ------------------------
    - copy that archive to the machine which will host the web service
    - uncompress it (tar zxvf tulipWebService.tar.gz)
    - enter the freshly created directory 'ws' (type: 'cd ws') and read the README file to know how
      to install and manage the web service.



PART 2 : INSTALL THE WEB APPLICATION
------------------------------------
(1) Configure how to access the web service
    ------------------------------------------
    - edit the 'WEB-INF/config/WebService.properties' file.
    - customize :
        * webService.adress : with the url of your tulip web service


(2) Configure the Highlighting
    --------------------------
    - edit the 'WEB-INF/config/Highlighting.properties' file.
    - customize :
        * 'highlightment.source.GO.hostname' with the hostname of the interpro web server.


(3) Configure how to access the search application
    ----------------------------------------------
    - edit the 'WEB-INF/config/Search.properties' file.
    - you can customize :
        * 'search.url' with the hostname of the server which hosts the search application.


(4) Configure how to access the graph2mif application
    -------------------------------------------------

    - edit the 'WEB-INF/config/graph2mif.properties' file.
    - you can customize :
        * 'graph2mif.url' with the full URL of the servlet which allow to interact with the service.
          eg. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/graph2mif/getXML


(5) Build the application war file
    ------------------------------
    run 'ant undeploy war deploy', will clean Tomcat build the application war file and install
    the web application in the local machine assuming you have $CATALINA_HOME correctly set as
    an environment variable.


(6) Start Tomcat
    ------------
    run 'ant start-tomcat' (once)- if this fails, simply go to your tomcat bin directory and start it manually from there.


(7) Test the web service (OPTIONAL)
    -------------------------------
    By running 'ant test-ws', you send a dummy TLP file to the web service and get back a
    list of protein's coordinates. Those coordinates are computed by Tulip.


(8) Try the web application
    -----------------------
    let's open a browser and go to http://[TOMCAT_HOSTNAME]/intact/hierarchView
