README for Search
**********************************************************************

DIRECTORIES:
/ (root)        : JSP and css files.
WEB-INF/lib     : Library files for web. All the files in this location are
                  included in the WAR file.
WEB-INF/classes : search specific (non Intact core) class files.
WEB-INF/tld     : The tag libraries.
WEB-INF/config  : Configuration/Property files for the application.
dist/           : Where the WAR file is created.

INSTALLATION
    edit repository.xml and OJB.properties in the intact root directory
    (intactCore/config) to suit your requirements (oracle vs postgres etc).
    Instead of editing these files manually, you may just run ant set-target-env
    from intactCore directory. The target environment is specified in the
    build.properties file (intactCore directory). 'search' has been tested
    under Oracle 8.1.6 and PostGres 7.2 (local and remote).

BUILD
    ant war
        prepares a WAR file to be deployed in a WEB container. The WAR file is
        created in the dist/ directory.

OTHER USEFUL COMMANDS
    ant deploy (Tomcat specific)
        deploys the WAR file in the dist/ location to the CATALINA_HOME/webapps. The
        environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for this command to work
        correctly.

    ant undeploy (Tomcat specific)
        reverses the effects of 'ant deploy' command. In addition to that, this
        command also stops the WEB server (Tomcat) if it is running. As with
        deploy command, the environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for
        this command to work correctly. An error message, displayed when trying
        to shutdown the WEB server if it is not running, can be safely ignored. In
        addition to removing the WAR file, this command also removes the
        expanded directory as well. For example, CATALINA_HOME/webapps/search
        directory is removed in addition to CATALINA_HOME/webapps/search.war file.

    ant undeploy war deploy (Tomcat specific)
        runs all three targets in the specified order. Undeploys the last deployment,
        creates a new war file and deploy it again.

NOTES
    The WAR file is being built using jar and class file from various locations.
    Given below are locations where it looks for these files:
        / (root)        - jsp and css files.
        WEB-INF/        - web.xml, struts-config.xml files and tld libraries.
        WEB-INF/lib     - all the jar files in this location.
        ../../dist/     - intact-core.jar file.
        ../../lib       - application common jar files (only a subset).
        WEB-INF/classes - search class files.
