<tr><td>shortlabel:<td> agonist

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> author-confidence
<tr><td>term:<td> Confidence classification assigned by the author of the publication

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> isoform-comment
<tr><td>term:<td> Protein isoform's comment for public view
<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> negative
<tr><td>term:<td> The interactions described in this experiment are not observed under these experimental conditions.

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> on-hold
<tr><td>term:<td> Experiment on hold until a defined date
<tr><td>definition:<td> Experiment on hold until a certain date. The date is shown in UniProt style as dd-MMM-yyyy as the first item of the line. Additional comments may be added in the same annotation. An experiment is only released if the on-hold comment has been DELETED, not automatically when it is exceeded.
<tr><td>example:<td> 30-JUL-2004: Authors expect publication in JBC in July 2004.

<tr><td>term:<td> PTM required for an interaction to occur.
<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> remark
<tr><td>term:<td> Internal remark
<tr><td>definition:<td> Internal remark. Will normally not be shown to the public.
<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> resulting ptm
<tr><td>term:<td> PTM occurs subsequent to interaction occuring
<tr><td>definition:<td> PTM occuring to one protein within the complex as a result of the complex formation.
<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> search-url
<tr><td>term:<td> Search engine URL.
<tr><td>definition:<td> Normally used for CvDatabase. The URL of a search engine which will retrieve an object by its primary  identifier.
<tr><td>example:<td> http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/niceprot.pl?${ac} is the search url for the database uniprot. If ${ac} is replaced by an SPTR accession number, the resulting URL http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/niceprot.pl?P12345 will retrieve the corresponding database object.
<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> search-url-ascii
<tr><td>term:<td> Search URL to retrieve an external entry in ASCII format
<tr><td>definition:<td> Normally used for CvDatabase objects. A URL to retrieve an external object by its accession number. Same as search-url, but the URL retrieves the external object as ASCII text.

<tr><td>term:<td> Stimulator of an interaction.
<tr><td>definition:<td> The interaction between the interactors can normally occur but is enhanced in the presence of his nodification or biological entity.

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> submitted
<tr><td>term:<td> Data submitted by author/s directly o IntAct.
<tr><td>definition:<td> Additional data relating to an existing interaction submitted by author/s directly to IntAct. This data will not in future be part of an publication.

<tr><td>term:<td> Text which is exported into UniProt as a "note" in the CC INTERACTION block.
<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> uniprot-dr-export
<tr><td>term:<td> Determines if the experiment is to be exported to UniProt DR lines.
<tr><td>definition:<td> Determines whether the interactions of an experiment should be exported to UniProt DR lines. This can be according to a setting in the CvInteraction controlled vocabulary, or by an explicit setting for an experiment.
<tr><td>comment:<td> For experiments: If set in an experiment, the setting overrides any setting derived from the CvInteraction controlled vocabulary. If this topic is set to value set by "author-confidence", e.g. "high", then this means only interactions with that author-confidence are to be exported to UniProt.
<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> url
<tr><td>term:<td> URL/Web address
<tr><td>definition:<td> The URL (Web address) at which to find more information on the object.
<tr><td>example:<td> Normally crossreferences will be entered as crossreference object with the appropriate accession number and database from the list of defined databases. However, in some cases the database many not be defined in IntAct, or the reference is to a web page, not a database with search by accession number. In this case, the appropriate URL can be inserted as a URL object.
<tr><td>example:<td> The home page of a database in a CvDatabase object, e.g. http://www.uniprot.org
