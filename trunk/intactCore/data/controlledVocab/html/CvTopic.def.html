<tr><td>term:<td> agonist: Activator of an interactor.

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>term:<td> author-confidence: Confidence classification assigned by the author of the publication
<tr><td>definition:<td> A confidence value assigned to an interaction by the author of a paper. This may be a numerical value or a classification into groups. There may be more than one author-confidence for an interaction if the author uses different systems to assign them.
<tr><td>example:<td> In the Giot dataset (giot-2003-ex1), one interaction can have one author-confidence "0.43" and one author-confidence "low", because the authors chose 0.5 as a cutoff for high-confidence interactions.

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>term:<td> uniprot-dr-export: Determines if the experiment is to be exported to UniProt DR lines.
<tr><td>definition:<td> Determines whether the interactions of an experiment should be exported to UniProt DR lines. This can be according to a setting in the CvInteraction controlled vocabulary, or by an explicit setting for an experiment.
<tr><td>comment:<td> For experiments: If set in an experiment, the setting overrides any setting derived from the CvInteraction controlled vocabulary. If this topic is set to value set by "author-confidence", e.g. "high", then this means only interactions with that author-confidence are to be exported to UniProt.

<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>term:<td> url: URL/Web address
<tr><td>definition:<td> The URL (Web address) at which to find more information on the object.
<tr><td>example:<td> Normally crossreferences will be entered as crossreference object with the appropriate accession number and database from the list of defined databases. However, in some cases the database many not be defined in IntAct, or the reference is to a web page, not a database with search by accession number. In this case, the appropriate URL can be inserted as a URL object.
<tr><td>example:<td> The home page of a database in a CvDatabase object, e.g. http://www.uniprot.org
