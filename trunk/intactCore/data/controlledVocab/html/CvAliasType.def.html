<tr><td colspan=2><hr><tr><tr><td>shortlabel:<td> locus-name
<tr><td>term:<td> Ordered locus name
<tr><td>definition:<td> A name used to represent an ORF in a completely sequenced genome or chromosome. It is generally based on a prefix representing the organism and a number which usually represents the sequential ordering of genes on the chromosome. Depending on the genome sequencing center, numbers are attributed only to protein-coding genes, or also to pseudogenes, or also to tRNAs and other features.
