term: affinity chromatography technologies
goid: MI:0004
definition: This class of approaches is characterised by the use of affinity resins as tools to purify proteins of interest (baits) and their binding partners. The baits can be captured by a variety of high affinity ligands linked to a resin - for example, antibodies specific for the bait itself, antibodies for specific tags engineered to be expressed as part of the bait or other high affinity binders such as gluthathione resins for GST fusion proteins, metal resins for histidine-tagged proteins.

term: anti tag coimmunoprecipitation
goid: MI:0007
definition: A specific antibody for the protein of interest is not available, therefore the bait protein is expressed as a hybrid protein fused to a tag peptide/protein for which efficient and specific antibodies or a specific ligand are available.

term: classical two hybrid
goid: MI:0018
definition: The "classical" yeast two-hybrid system is a method that uses transcriptional activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction. It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) , which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid proteins: a DNA-binding domain fused to a protein, X, and a transcription activation domain fused to a second protein, Y. These chimeric proteins are expressed in a cell containing one or more reporter genes under the control of a promoter that is activated by the transcription factor utilized in the assay. If the X and Y proteins do interact, they create a functional activator by bringing the activation domain into close proximity with the DNA-binding domain and as a consequence stimulate the expression reporter gene(s). While the assay has been developed and generally performed in yeast cells, it works similarly in mammalian cells and should be applicable to any other eukaryotic cells. This method has been used with a wide variety of proteins, including some that normally reside in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or mitochondria, or are peripherally associated with membranes. It can be used to detect interactions between candidate proteins, whose genes are available, by constructing the appropriate hybrids and by testing for reporter gene activity. Most significantly, the two-hybrid system can be used to screen libraries in which the activation domain is fused to a collection of cDNA. This allows the identification of proteins, among a large collection, that bind to a protein of interest. This procedure results in the immediate availability of the cloned gene for any newly identified protein. In addition, since multiple clones that encode overlapping regions of protein are often identified, the minimal domain for interaction may be readily apparent from the initial screen.

term: coimmunoprecipitation
goid: MI:0019
definition: In this approach an antibody, specific for the protein of interest (bait) or any tag expressed within a fusion protein, is used to separate the bait from a protein mixture or a cell lysate and to capture its ligand simultaneously. The protein partners that bind to the bait protein retained by the resin can then be eluted and identified.

term: protein complementation assay
goid: MI:0090
definition: The function of numerous proteins (enzymes, transcription factors, etc...) can be rationally dissected into two fragments that fold autonomously but cannot complement to reconstitute the protein function, unless they are located in close proximity. In a two hybrid experiment, restoration of the activity by complementation of the two fragments when expressed as fusion with two polypeptides is taken as an evidence that the two polypeptides interact together.

term: tandem affinity purification
goid: MI:0109
definition: The TAP method involves the fusion of the TAP tag (encoding a calmodulin binding peptide, a TEV cleavage site, and the Staphylococcus aureus Protein A) to the target protein and the introduction of the construct into the host cell or organism, maintaining the expression of the fusion protein at, or close to, its natural level. The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing, the bound material is released with EGTA. This two steps purification steps ensures a highly selective complex purification of the "Tapped" protein (first round of selection on the protein A, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag).
