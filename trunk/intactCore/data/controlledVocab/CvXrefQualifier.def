term: component: GO term for cellular component
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: function: GO term denoting function of the complex
definition: GO term denoting function of the complex.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: go-definition-ref: GO definition reference
definition: This qualifier is used when the crossreference is imported from the GO tag definition_reference.
remark_internal: Normally not used in manual curation.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: identity: Reference to the identical object in another database
example: The same protein, described in two different databases.
definition: This qualifier is used when the object referred to by the crossreference describes the same object. The reference will usually be done by primary accession number of the external database.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: isoform-parent: Reference to the master sequence from which this isoform has been derived.
definition: This qualifier is used when an isoform is created, the object refered is the protein to which the original sequence belongs.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: primary-reference: Used to indicate the PMID from which the experimental data is taken
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: process: GO term for biological process in which the complex is involved.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: secondary-ac: Secondary accession number
definition: This qualifier is used when the object referred to by the crossreference describes the same object, and the identifier used is a secondary identifier in the external database. Crossreferences using secondary accession numbers are only included in IntAct to allow to retrieve imported proteins by their secondary accession numbers.
remark_internal: Normally not used in manual curation.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: see-also: Related object in IntAct
definition: Related object in IntAct, usually of the same class.
example: Two experiments published by the same author in different papers, where the author refers to his previous work in one of them. In this case, the second experiment can optionally use an IntAct crossreference to the first experiment, using the reference qualifier "see-also".
