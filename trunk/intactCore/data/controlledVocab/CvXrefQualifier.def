shortlabel: secondary-ac
term: Secondary accession number
definition: This qualifier is used when the object referred to by the crossreference describes the same object, and the identifier used is a secondary identifier in the external database. Crossreferences using secondary accession numbers are only included in IntAct to allow to retrieve imported proteins by their secondary accession numbers.
remark: Normally not used in manual curation.

shortlabel: go-definition-ref
term: GO definition reference
definition: This qualifier is used when the crossreference is imported from the GO tag definition_reference.
remark: Normally not used in manual curation.

shortlabel: identity
term: Reference to the identical object in another database
example: The same protein, described in two different databases.
definition: This qualifier is used when the object referred to by the crossreference describes the same object. The reference will usually be done by primary accession number of the external database.

shortlabel: primary-reference
term: Used to indicate the PMID from which the experimental data is taken 

shortlabel: component
term: GO term for cellular component

shortlabel: process
term: GO term for biological process in which the complex is involved.

shortlabel: secondary-reference
term: refers to a related paper.

shortlabel: isoform-parent
term: Reference to the master sequence from which this isoform has been derived.
definition: This qualifier is used when an isoform is created, the object refered is the protein to which the original sequence belongs. 

shortlabel: function
term: GO term denoting function of the complex
