term: component: gene ontology term for cellular component
id: MI:0354
definition: Cross reference pointing to a Gene Ontology -'cellular component' term.
definition_reference: PMID:14681407

term: function: gene ontology term for cellular function
id: MI:0355
definition: Cross reference pointing to a Gene Ontology -'cellular function' term.
definition_reference: PMID:14681407

term: gene product
id: MI:0251
definition: Reference of a protein object pointing to its genomic or nucleic acid sequence.
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: go-definition-ref: gene ontology definition reference
id: MI:0242
definition: This qualifier is used when the crossreference is imported from the Gene Ontology tag definition_reference.
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: identity: identical object
id: MI:0356
example: The same protein, described in two different databases.
definition: Reference to the corresponding object in another database. Correspondence may be complete or partial.
comment: For instance this qualifier, in an interaction entry, can be associated to a cross reference to the same interaction in an other database.
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: intact-secondary: IntAct secondary accession number
definition: If an IntAct record has been public and then the content is transferred to a new IntAct object, the old object will be deleted, and the original accession number will be added to the new object with this xref qualifier. This applies to experiments, interactions, and interactors.
example: A TAP-style experiment has been wrongly inserted as binary interactions. The correct n-ary interactions will be created, and the old binary interactions will be deleted. The old interaction ACs will be added as xrefs with this qualifier.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: isoform-parent: isoform parent sequence reference
id: MI:0243
definition: Reference to the master sequence from which this isoform has been derived.
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: method reference
id: MI:0357
definition: Reference to a related paper which more fully describes either the experimental method or one or more of the interactors used within the experiment
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: primary-reference
id: MI:0358
definition: Used to indicate the PMID from which the experimental data is taken
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: process: gene ontology term for cellular process
id: MI:0359
definition: Cross reference pointing to a Gene Ontology -'cellular process' term.
definition_reference: PMID:14681407

term: secondary-ac: secondary accession number
id: MI:0360
definition: Reference to the corresponding object in another database (like "identity" xref qualifier) but the identifier used in the external database is a secondary identifier.
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: see-also
id: MI:0361
definition: Related object within the same database or pointing to external database.
example: Two experiments published by the same author in different papers, where the author refers to his previous work in one of them. In this case, the second experiment can optionally use an IntAct crossreference to the first experiment, using the reference qualifier "see-also".
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: target-species: Species which was the investigation target of the study.
definition: Many studies are difficult to perform e.g. in human. Hence experiments are often performed in e.g. yeast, but to infer knowledge on proteins from a different species, e.g. human. To clearly identify the target species on experiment level, this cross-reference qualifier is used. Primary identifier of the cross-reference is the taxid, secondary id is the species name.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: translocation
id: MI:0593
definition: Xref pointing to a GO process term describing the start and end location of a migrating molecule, for instance see GO:0006611, 'protein-nucleus export'.
definition_reference: PMID:14681407

term: translocation end
id: MI:0595
definition: Xref pointing to a GO compartment  term describing the end location of a migrating molecule.
definition_reference: PMID:14755292

term: translocation start
id: MI:0594
definition: Xref pointing to a GO compartment  term describing the start location of a migrating molecule.
definition_reference: PMID:14681407

term: xref type: cross-reference type
id: MI:0353
definition: Qualifier to describe the type of information a cross-reference is pointing to.
definition_reference: PMID:14755292
