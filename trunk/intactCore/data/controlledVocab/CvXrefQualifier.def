term: component: gene ontology  term for cellular component
id: MI:0354
definition: Cross reference pointing to a Gene Ontology -'cellular component' term.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: function: gene ontology  term for cellular function
id: MI:0355
definition: Cross reference pointing to a Gene Ontology -'cellular function' term.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: go-definition-ref: gene ontology definition reference
id: MI:0242
definition: This qualifier is used when the crossreference is imported from the GO tag definition_reference.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: identity: Reference to the corresponding object in another database. Correspondance may be complete or partial
id: MI:0356
example: The same protein, described in two different databases.
definition: This qualifier is used when the object referred to by the crossreference describes all or part of the same object. The reference will usually be done by primary accession number of the external database.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: isoform-parent: Reference to the master sequence from which this isoform has been derived.
id: MI:0243
definition: This qualifier is used when an isoform is created, the object refered is the protein to which the original sequence belongs.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: method: Reference to a related paper which more fully describes either the experimental method or one or more of the interactors used within the experiment
id: MI:0357
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: primary-reference: Used to indicate the PMID from which the experimental data is taken
id: MI:0358
definition: Used to indicate the PMID from which the experimental data is taken
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: process: gene ontology  term for cellular process
id: MI:0359
definition: Cross reference pointing to a Gene Ontology -'cellular process' term.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: secondary-ac: secondary accession number
id: MI:0360
definition: This qualifier is used when the object referred to by the crossreference describes the same object, and the identifier used is a secondary identifier in the external database. Crossreferences using secondary accession numbers are only included in IntAct to allow to retrieve imported proteins by their secondary accession numbers.
definition_reference: PMID:INTACT

term: see-also: Related object in IntAct
id: MI:0361
definition: Related object in IntAct, usually of the same class.
example: Two experiments published by the same author in different papers, where the author refers to his previous work in one of them. In this case, the second experiment can optionally use an IntAct crossreference to the first experiment, using the reference qualifier "see-also".
