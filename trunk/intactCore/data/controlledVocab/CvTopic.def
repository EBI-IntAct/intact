shortlabel: definition
term: Definition of the controlled vocabulary term

shortlabel: comment
term: Comment for public view

shortlabel: function
term: Biological Function of the Object
function: Describes the biological function of the Object.

shortlabel: url
term: URL/Web address
definition: The URL (Web address) at which to find more information on the object.
example: Normally crossreferences will be entered as crossreference object with the appropriate accession number and database from the list of defined databases. However, in some cases the database many not be defined in IntAct, or the reference is to a web page, not a database with search by accession number. In this case, the appropriate URL can be inserted as a URL object.
example: The home page of a database in a CvDatabase object, e.g. http://www.uniprot.org

shortlabel: remark
term: Internal remark
definition: Internal remark. Will normally not be shown to the public.

shortlabel: search-url
term: Search engine URL.
definition: Normally used for CvDatabase. The URL of a search engine which will retrieve an object by its primary  identifier. 
example: http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/niceprot.pl?${ac} is the search url for the database uniprot. If ${ac} is replaced by an SPTR accession number, the resulting URL http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/niceprot.pl?P12345 will retrieve the corresponding database object.

shortlabel: example
term: Example
definition: Comment topic used to mark examples, normally used for the explanation of controlled vocabulary terms.

shortlabel: prerequisite ptm
term: PTM required for an interaction to occur.

shortlabel: resulting ptm
term: PTM occurs subsequent to interaction occuring
definition: PTM occuring to one protein within the complex as a result of the complex formation.

shortlabel: isoform-comment
term: Protein isoform's comment for public view

shortlabel: disease
term: The interaction has a disease association.
comment: The interaction is shown to have a disease association OR

shortlabel: caution
term:  warning about errors/ grounds for confusion.

shortlabel: pathway
term: refers to the metabolic pathway that the interaction/complex is involved in.

shortlabel: search-url-ascii
term: Search URL to retrieve an external entry in ASCII format
definition: Normally used for CvDatabase objects. A URL to retrieve an external object by its accession number. Same as search-url, but the URL retrieves the external object as ASCII text.

shortlabel: confidence-mapping
term: Description of confidence mappings in the experiment
definition: Description of author-confidence mappings in the experiment. If more than one system of confidence mappings are used by the author, these will be described here.

shortlabel: author-confidence
term: Confidence classification assigned by the author of the publication
definition: A confidence value assigned to an interaction by the author of a paper. This may be a numerical value or a classification into groups. There may be more than one author-confidence for an interaction if the author uses different systems to assign them. 
example: In the Giot dataset (giot-2003-ex1), one interaction can have one author-confidence "0.43" and one author-confidence "low", because the authors chose 0.5 as a cutoff for high-confidence interactions.

shortlabel: negative
term: The interactions described in this experiment are not observed under these experimental conditions.
definition: It was demonstrated in this paper that these interactions do not occur under the experimental conditions described.

shortlabel: uniprot-dr-export
term: Determines if the experiment is to be exported to UniProt DR lines.
comment: For experiments: If set in an experiment, the setting overrides any setting derived from the CvInteraction controlled vocabulary. If this topic is set to value set by "author-confidence", e.g. "high", then this means only interactions with that author-confidence are to be exported to UniProt.
comment: For CvInteraction: For each term of the controlled vocabulary CvInteraction, this topic should be added, being set to "yes", "no", or an integer number n. If it is set to a number n, at least n independent experiments of this method are necessary to trigger an export of the DR line.
definition: Determines whether the interactions of an experiment should be exported to UniProt DR lines. This can be according to a setting in the CvInteraction controlled vocabulary, or by an explicit setting for an experiment.

shortlabel: on-hold
term: Experiment on hold until a defined date
definition: Experiment on hold until a certain date. The date is shown in UniProt style as dd-MMM-yyyy as the first item of the line. Additional comments may be added in the same annotation. An experiment is only released if the on-hold comment has been DELETED, not automatically when it is exceeded.
example: 30-JUL-2004: Authors expect publication in JBC in July 2004.
