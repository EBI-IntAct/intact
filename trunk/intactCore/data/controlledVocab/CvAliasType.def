term: locus name: ordered locus name
id: MI:0305
definition: A name used to represent an ORF in a completely sequenced genome or chromosome. It is generally based on a prefix representing the organism and a number which usually represents the sequential ordering of genes on the chromosome. Depending on the genome sequencing center, numbers are attributed only to protein-coding genes, or also to pseudogenes, or also to tRNAs and other features.
example: HI0934, Rv3245c, At5g34500, YER456W
comment: Also called OLN, ORF numbers, CDS numbers or Gene numbers.
comment: For instance   HI0934, Rv3245c, At5g34500, YER456W

term: orf name: open reading frame name
id: MI:0306
definition: A name temporarily attributed by a sequencing project to an open reading frame. This name is generally based on a cosmid numbering system.
example: MtCY277.28c, SYGP-ORF50, SpBC2F12.04, C06E1.1, CG10954.
comment: Also called Sequencing names or Contig names or Temporary ORFNames.
