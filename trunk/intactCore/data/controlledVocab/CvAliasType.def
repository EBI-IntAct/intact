shortlabel: gene-name
term: Gene name
definition: A current gene name for the object. Usually defined by a normative body, e.g. HUGO for human genes.

shortlabel: gene-name-synonym
term: Gene name synonym
definition: A synonym for a gene name.

shortlabel: isoform-synonym
term: Isoform synonym
definition: A synonym for a protein isoform.

shortlabel: orf-name
term: Open Reading Frame name
definition: A name temporarily attributed by a sequencing project to an open reading frame. This name is generally based on a cosmid numbering system. 
example: MtCY277.28c, SYGP-ORF50, SpBC2F12.04, C06E1.1, CG10954.
comment: Also called Sequencing names or Contig names or Temporary ORFNames.

shortlabel: locus-name
term: Ordered locus name
definition: A name used to represent an ORF in a completely sequenced genome or chromosome. It is generally based on a prefix representing the organism and a number which usually represents the sequential ordering of genes on the chromosome. Depending on the genome sequencing center, numbers are attributed only to protein-coding genes, or also to pseudogenes, or also to tRNAs and other features.
example: HI0934, Rv3245c, At5g34500, YER456W
comment: Also called OLN, ORF numbers, CDS numbers or Gene numbers.
