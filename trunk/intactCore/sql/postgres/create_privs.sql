  Package:    IntAct PostgreSQL DDL step 5 (run steps 1,2,3,4 first)

  Purpose:    Creates the privileges for Intact groups in a Postgres database, using dynamic SQL. Developed on 7.3.2 for Unix.

  Usage:      - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                Language PLpgSQL must be activated in your postgresql database to run this.
                You can do this through the next Unix command, supposing your database name is intact :
                     createlang plpgsql intact
              - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
               
              - if you use an account that owns the intact tables different than 'intact', replace the occurence of 
                ''intact'' in this script with ''yourusernamehere''


              - with psql, connect to Postgres as intact (or the different account you created)

              - suppose this script resides in /tmp , then give this command in psql :    
                     \i /tmp/create_privs.sql 
                     
              - to run actual trigger creation, next give this command in psql:
                     select make_privs ();
                     
              - type /dp to verify you have created the privileges
