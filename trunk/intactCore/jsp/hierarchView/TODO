	- have to be done
	+ currently under progress


+ interact with EGO (e.g. GOTerm.isAParent(GOTerm))

+ no depth limit (see hhe)

+ SVG integration 
  + SVG producing (batik)
  + SVG displaying (batik, CSIRO applet)
  - SVG handling (real zoom, panning, text searching, centering via URL ...)

+ Remove all internal links in Interpro
  -> modifying the simple.xsl file to customize our displaying

+ take over the application with Sugath
  + overview of the application
  + how to play with the web service

- building a script allowing to do the tedious task of managing the web service !

- update INTACTCORE/build.xml with the description flag to make some target visible from
  ant -projecthelp

- create then an external build.xml for hierarchView

- add some comments in properties files with #

- add logging facilities in the web service

- Find a way to check if a web service is currently running (in the runtime)

- update jsp/hierarchView/tulip/scripts/startService.sh with right messages
  don't speak anymore about 'Serveur' unless Bordeaux solve that problem !

- write a proper test directory for the web service

- solve browser behaviour problem
	o Netscape, remove frames

- Allows the web service to send error message

- Tomcat jar problem :
  We have to add xercesImpl.jar (found in the WEB-INF/lib of our web application) in the 
  $CATALINA_HOME/common/lib. It was not used when the jar file was in our application directory.
  This jar is needed because org.w3c.dom.DOMErrorHandler class is used when tomcat launch our application

- checkbox with struts.
  Maybe to store the bean in the session ?!

- If an error occurs during the highlightment process,
  the error is not caught currently and so, not reported in the Struts Level.
  So the user is not warned ! It seems that no GO term are found.
  cf. HighlightProteins when it call proteinToHighlight ()

- Document the way to launch the Tomcat server by taking care to run properly a new X server in the same window
  Xvfb :2.0 &
  setenv DISPLAY :2.0
  (run Tomcat)


==============
   D O N E
==============

- get a list of GO term from AC in the IntAct database

- put under CVS source code of cli, Serveur and console.

- Allow to read dinamically (in runtime) the URL of the Web Service, instead to have this hardcoded in the 
  following class :
  uk.ac.ebi.intact.application.hierarchView.business.tulip.client.generated.TulipAccessServiceLocator.java
  Maybe by reading a property file and editing the generated code !

- option of the highlightment source

- give a meaning for each displayed GO term in the right frame.

- Correcting the displaying if the interaction network :
	o label out of the image range

- cleaning the web.xml to avoid Tomcat exception in its startup
