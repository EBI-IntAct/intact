Before start tomcat, you have to start a server X to manage the graph generation. 
You have to do in the same terminale where you want to start tomcat :
	- Xvfb :2.0 &
	- setenv DIPLAY :2.0 (to give an adress in DIPLAY for the server X, DISPLAY is used by tomcat)
	- echo $DISPLAY (to check if DIPLAY have a good value)
