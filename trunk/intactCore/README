INSTALLATION
- edit the file config/repository.xml. You need to enter the access
  parameters for the database you are using. IntAct has been tested
  under Oracle 8.1.6 and PostGres 7.2.
- edit the file config/OJB.properties. You need to uncomment either
  SequenceManagerClass=uk.ac.ebi.intact.core.persistence.PostgresSequenceManager or
  SequenceManagerClass=uk.ac.ebi.intact.core.persistence.DbSequenceManager (for Oracle).


BUILD:
cd intactCore
ant compile


DOCUMENTATION:
doc/api/index.html


TEST APPLICATION:
This performs a full cycle of 
- database deletion
- database initialisation
- database fill
- simple query possibility:

scripts/testfill.sh user/password database small|large

"small" is for minimal tests, will need < 5 minutes.
"large" if full, real data from the Ho and Gavin experiments, 
will run > 1 hour.  

UNIT TESTS
Currently there are only unit tests for the IntactHelper class - specifically
for various ways of searching. The test itself can be run standalone using:

scripts/runHelperTests.sh IntactHelperTest

from the intactCore directory.

These should be OK - however if something goes wrong between the test
setUp/tearDown phases (eg test run interruption etc) then you will
need to remove the example test data from your database. Note that due
to integrity constraints on the data this must be done in the correct
order. 

There is an SQL script to do this - simply run cleanup_test_data.sql
in the usual way. However if for some reason this script fails, it is
still possible to remove the data manually, as follows:  

To delete the test items, perform the following:

1) connect to your DB as usual
2) run the SQL command

    delete from <tablename> where ac like 'EBITEST%';

for each relevant table. The <tablename> should be as follows, *in order*:

interactor
experiment
biosource
xref
controlledvocab
institution


PLEASE NOTE - it is not a good idea to run the test cases on the
full-blown intacttest database - one of the tests may result in pretty
much the whole DB being returned in that case!! Please just stick to
your own DB and the example data provided with intactCore and you
should be fine.
